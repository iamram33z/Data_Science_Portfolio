udPy-hc7XPI,P P S,"The hardest part in committing a mistake is to own it, feel bad for smith that he had to go thru this adversity and face the wrath of an entire nation. Most of us commenting here have made mistakes but, yet we deny to agree and look for excuses, that’s human."

udPy-hc7XPI,Shiva Kumar,I haven&#39;t seen a single boy being amazed to see Smith that&#39;s astonishing if Virat visits a school kids would have been so eager to meet him.Probably a difference in culture I guess.
udPy-hc7XPI,liam,Why is this guy still playing
udPy-hc7XPI,Wihan Gelderblom,"This is a amazing man,I’m from South Africa but all I can say is that “Steve your my idol” and your a great leader"
udPy-hc7XPI,gary pearce,"I am all out of superlatives to describe this incredible bloke.<br>He is an inspiration to all...what he went through in his Cricket life has no equal.<br>Standing down from the greatest job in the World...The Captain of Australia.<br>And what he has achieved on his return...leaves you gobsmacked...he maybe the greatest player that ever played.<br>This video was produced half way through his ban...and he was doing the circuit, speaking to kids in schools on mental health.<br>What an incredible man he is."
udPy-hc7XPI,Never give up,"Im also facing mental issues in my life , but steve smith is the man who helped me to overcome and start working on my goals. Im thankful to god ."
udPy-hc7XPI,Anirudh Sridhar,Now see how he cameback after that
udPy-hc7XPI,Chris Bowman,Steve Smith seems like a pretty decent bloke. He made one (big) mistake on a cricket field but he’s served his time. Hats off to him for this.

udPy-hc7XPI,Kishan gupta,V. k of aus😎
udPy-hc7XPI,Dave Rogers,"I am a South African through and through. At the time of the incident at Newlands, I felt very sorry for Steve. I felt that the continued sledging over the years by Australian cricketers had contributed to this incident and Steve took the wrap for this accumulated karma. At the time of writing Steve is, yet again, re-writing cricket history by making his bat talk. He has definitely come through this a better person. I am a true admirer of his contribution both on and off the field."
udPy-hc7XPI,Shaquille Simpson,cheattttttttt cheatttttt cheatttttt....he is ah phonyyyyy
udPy-hc7XPI,Devil City,"A real Australian cheat, will do anything to Win, Australian Policy. Part of the Australian package just like the other Captain before him."

udPy-hc7XPI,shaurya vardhan,"Whats done is done . I am just happy to see him play again . Claiming the Throne ,that has always been his . <br>Greatest test batsman of the modern era."
udPy-hc7XPI,Dave Spellbound,"both teams got reeverse swing so both had to be guilty of ball tampering. Since the ban noone gets reverse swing. Coincidence? No, So it was a ban that had to happen for the sake of  fair cricket"
udPy-hc7XPI,Romeo Abeygunawardena,"Smith is the greatest batsman alltime,and the sandpaper story is a simple mistake which he agreed to his teammates did.that will nöt make him a cheat,there are real cheaters in asian cricket teams who can be bribed for money.but nobody call them cheaters?"
udPy-hc7XPI,George,"As an Englishman, the way Steve has handled what he did wrong and then not only used it to help others but also come back and score so heavily, is inspiring and is a great example to the young cricketers of today. As he said, to show vulnerability is important for mental health, especially for men. Let’s hope the Ashes this year are unforgettable, no matter who wins."
udPy-hc7XPI,Atta Rehman,Everybody makes mistakes. Nobody is perfect. What a player this guy is
udPy-hc7XPI,Ulbre De Folie,"Good on not only Steve Smith but Gus Worland and the whole Gotcha for life team.<br>The gift of your time in invaluable, so thank you."

udPy-hc7XPI,Khan RAHIL,great  player  Steve  Smith  no  1  i
udPy-hc7XPI,Tejinder Singh,He is really a good bloke. Instead of blaming others he claimed  himself as completely accountable for the incident in Cape town. It&#39;s too hard to take blame on ourself . It requires so much of courage . His only mistake was he didn&#39;t stop this go happen. He even said that he had opportunity to stop it. Such a good sportsman he is.

dj5qc6tVUn8,abhishek upamanyu,This match was fixed. It is evident from Lyon&#39;s face and hand fluff. England is desperate to have its viewership back and they bribed Aussies for this win. Such a shame because I think Stokes is a wonderful cricketer but he lacks integrity.

The ball can&#39;t be in straight line scientifically. The umpire is right here, it is the ball tracker technology, that is wrong."

dj5qc6tVUn8,Bully Maquire,Joel Wilson should have done the smart thing and given it out seeing as England still had a review up their sleeve and Aus didn’t. Easier said than done in the moment but as a professional he should have been wary of that.

dj5qc6tVUn8,Steve Fewster,Lyon what a moby dick
dj5qc6tVUn8,fiddlestickz muzik,"imo the umpire got it right, there was enough doubt as there always is with spinners, to say no, use a review if you think you can overturn, that&#39;s what they are for, the umpire should always say no if there&#39;s any doubt at all, he doesn&#39;t have to count how many reviews you have left, he has to just umpire each ball. That ball was drifting down legside for mine and hawkeye for whatever reason made it spin back,.. off 2 pads mind you, towards the stumps. Hawkeye cannot show the path of a ball that has hit two pads as hitting the stumps..impossible."

Z4_S3SSh-wM,Shahzeb Shah,Hey where is the recent blunder from Nathan Lyon that cost Australia the Ashes?
XKDi2ekNa8A,YEGGYDEGZ,"This guy is an absolute clown. Laughs hard at his own jokes, even when they aren&#39;t funny. Came across him on some Aussie shows during the ashes. Embarrassed for him, and for the coverage in general actually. I never realised until this summer that the pom bashing from aussies is due to the huge chip on their shoulder. It smacks of deep rooted insecurities. Bless em."
XKDi2ekNa8A,Greg Johnson,"when he was on abc cricket ,after lunch he was always pissed"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Alan Telford,"(saying this as a Kiwi) I love the sense of humour that Australian&#39;s have... and Kerry&#39;s is amongst the best! I can&#39;t work out though, how he manages to keep is teeth in when he laughs. Great product there!"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Robert Alker,Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh...... I needed that.  A great big roaring laugh.

XKDi2ekNa8A,N L,“only bob marley could find grass in that” 🤣🤣🤣🤣
XKDi2ekNa8A,Ian Gascoigne,That’s one weird looking bloke.
XKDi2ekNa8A,Sean Adamson,Dude loves his jokes alot more than everyone else.
XKDi2ekNa8A,ArchibaldBagge,I remember at the SCG the crowd listening to ABC radio commentary on headphones  suddenly a huge laugh would erupt in the crowd. Skull was in the box.
XKDi2ekNa8A,John Danvers,Incredible in the Commentary Box
XKDi2ekNa8A,Nino,"Kerry is the embodiment of the saying, “it takes a smart man to act the fool”.<br>He may be funny, but you can see his intelligence when calling cricket, and always generous in his appraisal of player no matter the team. Would be a huge success commentating in the UK - does he already do this?"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Rishi Dixit,Open face slapper 😂
XKDi2ekNa8A,Cameron Fay,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKDi2ekNa8A&amp;t=3m57s"">3:57</a> Skull complained that Mark Waugh never laughs at his jokes, but he got him there 😂"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Cameron Fay,"Very funny but also a bit sad too to hear numerous references to Warnie’s lifestyle, which was glorious to behold but who knows, I’m not his doctor, but lack of sleep, ciggies in the morning and party pies aren’t a recipe for a long healthy life. At least he had fun with the time he had!"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Gazman Melb,Fantastic perwonality Kerry has.<br>Only one thing I disagree on..........<br>I think T20 Big Bash has hurt ODIs more than Test cricket.<br>The only format I really loved was 50 over ODIs and they taken that away so cricket to me is dead.<br>Personally I think ODIs are the ultimate test of a batsman and bowler.
XKDi2ekNa8A,Mark Dowse,Skull.<br>A lifetime of BATTING ABOVE HIS AVERAGE!  😄<br>Genius. 👍😁<br>M 🦘🏏😎
XKDi2ekNa8A,Rebecca Stone,We need him back commentating!
XKDi2ekNa8A,villan81,"Never even seen this bloke before until now, Aussies own version of Bumble! The Bob Marley comment would have got him sacked here in the UK 😆😆😆😆 genius!!!!"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Mitch C,Absolute moron. Laughs at his own jokes.
XKDi2ekNa8A,Gazman Melb,"Well you&#39;ve got to admit he way funnier than I Chappell, R Benaud, T Greig and Mark Nicholas...............but who isn&#39;t? 😉"

XKDi2ekNa8A,Joash Johnston,One of my favorites
XKDi2ekNa8A,Joash Johnston,No darling virats batting 🤣🤣
XKDi2ekNa8A,Bruce Storey,"Stellar career. Massive total of 23 tests, bowlling ave of 38 runs per wicket. Probably a great guy, but trades on a stupid affected laugh used on his own &quot;jokes&quot;. Occasionaly interrupts anecdotes with commentary. Not a fan."
XKDi2ekNa8A,Rob Cicero,"I&#39;m not a cricket tragic, nor even a fan, but have to say that Kerry O&#39;Keeffe is absolutely hilarious!! :)"
XKDi2ekNa8A,hoesAtMyToes,No darling virat&#39;s batting...
XKDi2ekNa8A,arjyajyoti goswami,imagine this guy in his youth !!!! And chilling with his friends
XKDi2ekNa8A,friktion rc,I wish he was commentating back when I was a kid back in the 70s/80s I’d have loved cricket sooo much more.
XKDi2ekNa8A,Bipolarlife,Got choppers like Beaves and Butthead
XKDi2ekNa8A,R.C Jones,Kerry O&#39;Keeffe is an Australian National Treasure
XKDi2ekNa8A,libertyordeaf,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKDi2ekNa8A&amp;t=3m01s"">3:01</a> These days it&#39;s more a case of &quot;She called me into bed at 1am and I said, &#39;No darling, Virat&#39;s batting, just give me 10 minutes&#39;.&quot;"
XKDi2ekNa8A,Paul O'Brien,I really would love to find the line he said when commenting on ABC radio describing the fading light late in the day and maybe they could get Shane Warne to field in close to the pitch .... a reference to Warne&#39;s whiter than white teeth....
XKDi2ekNa8A,Vicky Yadav,Open face slapper🤣😂👍
XKDi2ekNa8A,Saurabh Tiwari,😂😂😂
XKDi2ekNa8A,Ancient Ruins,"Kerry is why radio commentries not just in his early era but still has made it more interesting cause he knows how to make people laugh, cry but  more importantly his self confidence is  where his delivery is very educational in many ways. Life is somthing he shows how to enjoy as we all have bad day."
XKDi2ekNa8A,Simon Crawley,Fucking genius.

SQfEWmpSPd8,yahooo oooo,Instead of insulting any team with your stupid humour like most of the Aussies does and think thy are the superior in cricket than remember Langer and Gilchrist were out twice in famous series during 2000 to waseem. Respect the other teams and nations and individuals.
SQfEWmpSPd8,beardan76,"The rectagular square thing is nonsense. You dont need that, just need proper preparation. Just need to work hard and not fish. Will need to bowl well tomorrow but 240 is 240. If can get thru Warner and Smith and keep going it may be ok. If two or three Aus bats settle in 240 wont be good enough. Interesting day ahead."

Who was with Hookes when he died? Who was coach when &quot;sandpaper gate&quot; happened? I am sure there are many other things that went on when he was a player. A good cricketer, but a terrible person. He should have disappeared into the wilderness after the disgrace in South Africa. Instead, FOX has given him a job and plenty of pats on the back."

VIwsNaWizjU,Yaekos,"@bmrcoachingacademy8531, Ironic..."
VIwsNaWizjU,Alex Douglas,"Warne would never lie. Not about this. Not about &#39;John&#39; the bookmaker. Not about taking PEDS, which was his Mum giving him diet pills."
VIwsNaWizjU,Yaekos,RIP Legend
VIwsNaWizjU,Michael Mansini,Listening to this max volume on some expensive quality headphones it isn&#39;t Warne&#39;s voice.  Especially on the last word &quot;throw&quot; its clearly not Warne
VIwsNaWizjU,Fountain Abshaar,"Miss you Hero ,King of not only spin but hearts♥️,thanks FOX CRICKET for this upload"
VIwsNaWizjU,Fountain Abshaar,"Shane Warne was a ridiculously loyal and Honest man and always fearlessly owned whatever he would have done,when king said he didn&#39;t say that so it is confirmed there no need to even argue..it wasn&#39;t even that bad ,i like this video nicely represented the dumboos behind it"
VIwsNaWizjU,Pandit Pastor Maulana Singh,"Cricket,s &quot;Scotty too Hotty&quot;   was a  entertainment. Scott was tall big and he could bowl fast. He could have played in any other era or team and made it really big. <br><br>Still He lives on in the history of Aussie Cricket."
VIwsNaWizjU,Sam Jones,"Was Warne, &#39;Joe&#39; took the fall at the behest of Nine."
VIwsNaWizjU,Aaditya Chudasama,Warnie said it. Period.
VIwsNaWizjU,Eliza Moylan,&quot;Would of said it to ya face&quot; well that didnt age well.
VIwsNaWizjU,JB Explores,It doesn’t even sound like Warney wtf
VIwsNaWizjU,Anthony Kernich,That&#39;s not Warne
VIwsNaWizjU,Benjamin Dare,I know Scotties son
VIwsNaWizjU,Russo Swerve,It was definitely Warne.  He’s near the stump mic after a throw off his bowling went over the keeper’s head.  How Warne found Joe to cover him in the first place is still unknown.  And Warne is overly defensive with this and joe seems like he’s trying to get someone to believe him
VIwsNaWizjU,centenary park,We need camera footage from the other end to see if warney was speaking
VIwsNaWizjU,Adam Forward,Well. Whoever said it was right. He couldn&#39;t throw. Jury out on the bowling but fairly sure he could bowl better than the meat pies I served up. 😁
VIwsNaWizjU,Montana jack,"It was Warne, no doubt."
VIwsNaWizjU,petersbarry,It was Joe the camera man
VIwsNaWizjU,wadaglue 84,I loved Warnie as a player but i still reckon he said it. Joe&#39;s been paid to say this.
VIwsNaWizjU,Rishabh Shukla,The thing is it was John Cena !!
VIwsNaWizjU,Pilkie101,I know it was you mate
VIwsNaWizjU,Krishna Patel,CIA investigation on a comment.
VIwsNaWizjU,Ciaran,ACA interviewing Joe while he has the camera gear on is the real weird part of this &quot;controversy.&quot;
VIwsNaWizjU,Saad Sohail,Warney paid him clearly
VIwsNaWizjU,Aryan Rawat,Why the hell are they clarifying it goddamn 20 years later. And how was it a big controversy dont teammates say such stuff they even abuse each other just like normal friends do
VIwsNaWizjU,Carpet Punter,Chee Quee you fucken legend
VIwsNaWizjU,051Jatin bhagat,I thought it was ryback from wwe . LoL.
VIwsNaWizjU,MUNTJUNK-PLK,Definitely doesn’t sound like Warney
VIwsNaWizjU,james wills,This somehow only convinced me further that Warney said it.
VIwsNaWizjU,Arctic Wanderer,Muller and Gilly made their debut together. One had a better career than the other.😉
VIwsNaWizjU,Toni G,"Interview the man...they def did as they started with him and his 2 panel members.   <br>As someone else said, didn&#39;t smoke, didnt do drugs...scandal after scandal with this bloke."
VIwsNaWizjU,Paul Steven,I work with someone who is a long term friend of Mark Waugh. Mark told him it was Shane &amp; they were even joking about in the change room that day. Maybe Shane is just practicing to become a politician.
VIwsNaWizjU,Loxxov Voxxol,also....are we going to wheel this crap out in another 10 years?       i came here from a different video that was 10 years on from the original....&quot;incident&quot;  (or non issue as it should have been)
VIwsNaWizjU,Loxxov Voxxol,"Didn&#39;t sound anything like Shane then....still doesn&#39;t today.<br><br><br>How anyone can think it was Warnie, i have no idea......it&#39;s kinda funny in a troll kind of way i suppose.....but, clearly it was Joe the Camera Man Guy"
VIwsNaWizjU,blackopman1,Conspiracy theories abound.
VIwsNaWizjU,J D,Warney must still be paying him to lie
VIwsNaWizjU,Dane the Pain,still remember watching it live .. was very clear.<br>Ive always believed it was Simon Odonnell who said it.<br><br>it only blew up days later when ‘the Panel’ on ch10 replayed it with that audio turned right up - they were the ones who suggested Warney and it was all on from there.<br><br>also have to put my hand up as someone who has a copy of that 6nOut album .. payed 50cents for it in an opp shop years ago - no surprises that the music is terrible
VIwsNaWizjU,Dazza G,"I was working working at 9 back then, Security with John &amp; Wayne Bennett (The Kray Bro&#39;s) ,Broady,Jacko,Dabbers &amp; the Wokeye.<br>from the moment it all happened Joe admitted it was him."
VIwsNaWizjU,The Dancing Hobo,"Yeh Shane your innocent... just like you never took money from a bookie, never failed a drug test, never cheated on your wife, never bashed that porn star in a hotel room, never........."
VIwsNaWizjU,munawar jamal,"Deadpool, that you?"
VIwsNaWizjU,Jungking7,Cool
VIwsNaWizjU,Iron Spider,That sounded more like Bill Lorry
VIwsNaWizjU,Aaron Melbourne,"Funny how it is a Fox Sports interview, the mob who employ Warne."
VIwsNaWizjU,BMR Coaching Academy,"No doubt Warne said this,"
VIwsNaWizjU,Fred Bloggs,Joe: ‘it was definitely me’ and ‘i don’t even remember saying it’.
VIwsNaWizjU,ANDREW Smith,"Amazing how lies can become truth if they are repeated often enough. Ian Healy recently tried to tell everyone that the comment wasn&#39;t broadcast. He&#39; guaranteed&#39; that no-one ever heard it.<br>I was watching in my living room when it was broadcast. The comment wasn&#39;t  &quot;cant bowl, cant throw&#39; as everyone seems to think. It was &#39;He can&#39;t throw and he can&#39;t bowl&#39;. No-one will ever convince me that it wasn&#39;t Shane Warne&#39;s voice."

3JmpKjp6Fbo,Mohammad Zamin,"I suppose dirty laundry should not be aired in Public but the fact was Pakistan cricket was heavily politicised when Imran and Miandad left. The team though great was divided into 2 camps, one Wasim&#39;s and the other Waqar&#39;s. And this did not help the team at all since many fine players were caught in the crosshairs. Both were terrible captains also."
3JmpKjp6Fbo,Tanvir Hussain,Not to forget the most good looking pair of bowlers. Their presence made cricket into an entertainment industry
3JmpKjp6Fbo,Cletus Sequeira,bring them back.. they were the most lethal when in form !

3JmpKjp6Fbo,Miachal Alan,No.1 fast bowling pair in cricket history
3JmpKjp6Fbo,Muhammad Ali,"For some unexplained reason the curator left a very sporting amount of grass on the wicket, which was very much to the liking of the Pakistani opening pair of Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram. So much so that speaking to Kumar Dharmesena – who played in that game and is now a Test umpire – many years later, he recounts going up to inspect the pitch and coming across Waqar tossing the ball up smiling, looking down at the pitch, and casually asking, “Kumar, do you like watching murder films?”.<br><br>No sooner had the match started than Sri Lanka were bowled out for 71. Pakistan went on to amass a very large first-innings total, and then bowled us out again inside three days, which was unfortunate because if our batting had held out on that third day we would have drawn the Test match; as it usually does in Kandy, it started raining and rained continuously for the next two-and-a-half days, so we missed drawing the match by an hour.<br><br>Kumar Sangakkara"

3JmpKjp6Fbo,Muhammad Bilal,Legacy of the Great Imran Khan. Best Fast bowling partnership of their time.
3JmpKjp6Fbo,Sai Abhiram Bandhakavi,The most exciting fast bowling combination in the history of cricket. Masters of reverse swing and bowling with the old ball they brought a new dimension to the game. Also in their playing days they didn&#39;t like each other and that created rivalry between them but in return benefited Pakistan as they were able to clean batting line ups and win matches for their country.

3JmpKjp6Fbo,VikkyRozay,Despite being the best bowlers in the world. they are also lying. both purposely under performed when each was captain and even refused to play. Waqar should have been the best bowler ever. nigga retired at 32 WTF.
3JmpKjp6Fbo,nc,"Bc akhtar ko bhi lao...timid,feta tagda,badmash.."
3JmpKjp6Fbo,holypunk12,Too much covering of the bitter truth! Wasim did hinder waqars progress! Many times he was captain he did not select him in games- 1999 world cup is one example! They really had big ego issues!
3JmpKjp6Fbo,Ganguly Raj,If the Pakistani fielders knew how to catch both of them would have had over 700 test wickets.

I don&#39;t think there is any batting lineup that could have a better chance against this bowling attack, unfortunately it never happened. Was and Wiqi were too old by 2003"

3JmpKjp6Fbo,Muhammad Mustafa Raza,"Both are legends, known for being extraordinary in the Cricketing field. But I would like to differ Wasim Akram saying it was a healthy rivalry. It wasn&#39;t a healthy rivalry. Waqar led the rebellious players after the 1993 Sharjah Cup. Wasim took revenge from Waqar and dropped him several times. Even in the 1996 England tour, he urged selectors to drop Waqar, which they didn&#39;t. Waqar replied by taking Eight wickets in the match and was declared Man of the Match. During 1999 Australian tour, again Waqar was dropped"

9V7SprQEyVU,don bon,I THOUGHT THIS WAS A LESBIAN PORNO SCENE
9V7SprQEyVU,AK RAY 11,Smash sisters 😂😂😂😂<br>Sounds so inappropriate when you think about it
feYjR22rPOE,manurocks4ever,Uzzie just scored an ashes 100 in england. RIP Shane Warne but boy you were wrong
feYjR22rPOE,javajuice,this aged beautifully
feYjR22rPOE,Mohammad Khan,“He may never play test cricket again”.
feYjR22rPOE,Amer Muzamil,The joke is now on these jokers after Usman&#39;s centuries in the Sydney ashes test! Look at his name &#39;Crash&#39; !
feYjR22rPOE,Shah Zafar,Watching this 2 years later and probably the greatest ashes come back ever! Finding it really funny
feYjR22rPOE,Faisal Qureshi,So this has aged quite well /s
feYjR22rPOE,Charlie,Who are these people?? And guess who is laughing today???
feYjR22rPOE,Ahsan Atta Rao,Shame on all of them as he is in the test team again🤣
feYjR22rPOE,Chris Munro,Jokes on you mate
feYjR22rPOE,GoogleTook MyOriginalUsername,This aged well
feYjR22rPOE,Ali Kazmi,The joke is on who? 2022 Khawaja is back and boy oh boy is he on fire......
feYjR22rPOE,K C,He just shove two hundreds up warnes fat rear
feYjR22rPOE,Santosh Nautiyal,Shut up old man... He&#39;s back with a BANG. 🥸🥸
feYjR22rPOE,bond. james bond,"Now warne wants mitchel marsh instead of khwaja, hey warne dont you see what happen to butler in test cricket ashes  !"
feYjR22rPOE,Lloyd Sharma,Mark Waugh was lazy elegance ....<br>Usman Khawaja is just lazy ....<br><br>We want Travis Head to work cos he&#39;s the future .... with a poor away record ....<br>Usman has a really poor away record and that&#39;s why he&#39;s not selected  .... <br><br>I feel Uzzie has suffered for two reasons: that he isn&#39;t the ideal description of what a champion Aussie should look like and 2. that he is opinionated and speaks his mind. <br><br>Also Crash referring to Marnus listening to the selectors is just crazy and biased and completely what I would expect from Crash Craddock. Could we please stop him from speaking further on aussie cricket?
feYjR22rPOE,Floodwaters,"Khawaja made the team before Smith and Warner, equally as talented but his massively underachieved."
feYjR22rPOE,ABRAR DAIYAN,How in the world is that a dig at warne???
feYjR22rPOE,Ali Khan,Khawaja great  best man
feYjR22rPOE,Anmol Kabra,"Who saved your asses in India and uae in the 2019 winter when Warner, Smith took the leave it was marsh and Usman and now they&#39;re out of the team and players like Joe burns, wade, Paine, head are getting chances👏👏"
feYjR22rPOE,Anirudh A,"Cricket Australia have wasted such a talent! If he was used as a specialist opener in both tests and ODIs, he would&#39;ve been a legend by now! Number 3 just isn&#39;t his position! Remember when he saved a test match single handedly from the jaws of defeat in UAE against Pakistan? Remember when he was the main reason for the ODI series win against India in India?"
feYjR22rPOE,VLocity,He’s underrated
feYjR22rPOE,Shuaib Mansha,Usman is class and these lot not liking it.but if Usman was white not a brown colour skin.he would be no.1 pick
feYjR22rPOE,Banabas Jacky,"Natural herbs have cured so many illness that drugs and injection cant cure. I&#39;ve seen the great importance of natural herbs and the wonderful work they have done in people&#39;s lives. i read people&#39;s testimonies online on how they were cured of herpes, HIV, diabetics etc by Dr Ediale herbal medicine, so i decided to contact the doctor because i know nature has the power to heal anything. I was diagnosed with HIV for the past( 4) years but Dr Ediale  cured me with his herbs and i referred my cousin and her husband to him immediately because they were both suffering from herpes but to God be the glory, they were cured too .I know is hard to believe but am a living testimony. There is no harm trying herbs. He is also a spell caster, he cast spell to restore broken marriages and he cast good luck spells to prosper and excel in life. Contact Dr Ediale  on: /<a href=""http://whatsapp.com/"">whatsapp.com</a> :or call him (+2348109213597) Email Dr Ediale8@<a href=""http://gmai.com/"">gmai.com</a> thank you......"
feYjR22rPOE,Mitch Gardner,It&#39;s just a toss. Why is it such a big deal. These people talking are just jelous they never got the opportunity. They just want to make people look bad.
feYjR22rPOE,Amer Muzamil,Who are these people ? No one even knows their names !!! Khawaja is only out of the test side because his last name isn&#39;t Marsh.
feYjR22rPOE,Raptor,"This host Tony Squires and the old white guy Robert Craddock are two of the biggest racists in Australian TV. They constantly target anyone that is not from their own race whether it is South Asian, Spanish, Eastern European. This show needs a clean out."
feYjR22rPOE,green world,Now no racism no criticism because we are all going to die and the world is going to End so there is no time to discuss rubbish like this 😆🤣😝
feYjR22rPOE,Halo 5 Gamer,Is just that we are Muslims and they don’t respect Muslims. That’s the controversy between the world who just does not seems to understand that Muslims are also humans with blood just like others
feYjR22rPOE,samra nisar,😡
feYjR22rPOE,Rehana,Who HATES!!!!!!!!!  Shane Warne  like if you do
feYjR22rPOE,faraz asrar,Khawaja deserves Test return
feYjR22rPOE,Jim 83,"Bunch of stupid Aussies who bang on about nonsense in some weird alpha-centric, try hard banterish manner. <br><br>Who would have thought"
feYjR22rPOE,Science 🔭,Say what you want to say but he performs all the time he is not loud mouth
feYjR22rPOE,Akhtaruzzaman Joy,Didn&#39;t he score big in world cup? He didn&#39;t get enough in ashes. Warner also had a bad ashes but yeah 😑😒
feYjR22rPOE,Abd rider,currently to useless test crickets are playing into  aus test squad travis head and m. wade. usman is much better than these two. he should be in sqaud.
feYjR22rPOE,Chakerz 123,He should play instead of head or wade
feYjR22rPOE,KH T,Everyone&#39;s a critic.
feYjR22rPOE,i p,Does Australian politics revolves around Muslims ?
feYjR22rPOE,aussiepete89,Cynical rubbish panel.
feYjR22rPOE,Falah T,nailed it
feYjR22rPOE,Lahiru pavan,i like his batting ❤
feYjR22rPOE,Rahul Nuthakki,"You people make no sense. You said in one breath that he doesnt listen to selectors / criticism and then in the next breath you said that he listens to criticism and responds. You also said that he did that in the past. So, which is it??? If you could get paid millions for doing a job this bad, I reckon every bloke off the street could make more because they would make more sense than you."
feYjR22rPOE,MWF co,"Khawaja has to be one of the more resilient players Ive seen in the last decade, he&#39;s been taken in and out of the team (sometimes over not doing home work?) he&#39;s had old players hammering him in the media and on commentary even when he&#39;s playing well. Warne said he wanted to &quot;shake&quot; Usman .. WHAT THE?!? Ian Healy called him Lazy?! <br><br>They hammer him when he doesn&#39;t get runs but the same people who drop him or put him down kept picking the Marsh brothers for years (Mitch Marsh the worst no6 of all time - check the stats).<br><br><br>When Steve Smith and Warner got suspended, Langer told Usman he was the senior player of the team and needed to step up, meanwhile he had Travis Head and Mitch Marsh both Co captain - Head had barley been in the test side while Usman was the captain of the QLD BULLs but couldnt get the vice captaincy even when no one was left???  Talk about a slap in the face. <br><br> <br><br>Then you see videos like this with people calling him sensitive I havent seen Usman really have a go at anyone his entire career and even after all of this he&#39;s still got a smile on his face doing the coin toss. <br><br><br><br>We&#39;ve got a lot of players going on leave with mental health issues so people should back off with these sort of comments &quot;sensitive&quot; &quot;lazy&quot; - have a look at Usmans social media pages this guy cops more abuse then any other player.<br><br><br><br>Even in the Ashes he got more runs then most of the players but was dropped and hasn&#39;t  returned - meanwhile Travis head has who has a worse average then usman.<br><br><br>On top of that he averages over 50 in Australia in Test matches so the fact he wasn&#39;t picked is a joke! <br><br><br>Good on you Usman even with all the crap that gets slung your way your still playing and have a smile on your face."
feYjR22rPOE,Abdul Azeem,Khawaja has always been treated poorly by x players like warne Mark Taylor and Ian healy.<br><br>Hes lazy and sensitive apparently yet hes having a laugh with a coin toss and you guys do a video on it trying to twist it as a dig at warne 😂🤷‍♂️<br><br>If his last name was Marsh and he wasnt born in pakistan he would captained Australia after Smith left no doubt in the world
feYjR22rPOE,7th sense,3 minutes of textbook racism. wow. Adam Spencer the only one who didn&#39;t engage.
feYjR22rPOE,Bush Rat101,He is still a champion in or out of the test side
feYjR22rPOE,Faisal Ahmad,Why drop a player that averages over 40 in tests... pathetic selection
feYjR22rPOE,Zico Mitchell,They&#39;re criticizing him for no reason. How is that at all a dig at Warne. Honestly everyone on this panel is a joke!
feYjR22rPOE,David Goat,Biggest Tosser in Australian Cricket! LOL hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahha
feYjR22rPOE,Saad Kidwai,Khawaja has mostly always been at the short end of the stick ... he avgs 90+ Aus but still not picked?<br><br>Aussies always have a new flavor of the season at the start of the season ... then they fall back to the usual operator (Smith) ... rest are just human.
feYjR22rPOE,Your Mission,Warne has it in for so many players for no reason. Other than Khawaja guys like Starc and O&#39;Keefe come to mind easily
feYjR22rPOE,poopflinger,"these blokes have in for khawaja i swear, how is that a dig at warne at all lol"

bR69UyNwYkc,Parth Mhatre,The man who is speaking With Tim Paine who is that?
bR69UyNwYkc,Mac Tc,"If things went right, TIm Paine could be Australias best captain. He deserves so much more."
bR69UyNwYkc,greyman003,"Tim was so unlucky for so long. He was always a brilliant keeper, injuries stalled his career. To see him as captain and playing well is brilliant. Well deserved."
bR69UyNwYkc,Kiran Putul,"Tim was called temporary captain but then due Smith&#39;s ball tempering case ., he became permanent."
bR69UyNwYkc,Elizabeth Morris,"The ill-fated flax definitely undress because sink ultimately practise concerning a quiet authority. two, jaded felony"
bR69UyNwYkc,AndviSa B,With average batting I feel Tim paine would not have made it to Australia playing 11 had there not been ban on Smith and Warner.. He is lucky to become captain.. Though he handled team very well during crisis.. He is a classy guy.. I respect him..
bR69UyNwYkc,Mushy V12,Paine is one of the best Aus wicket Keepers ever in my opinion 😀

hLldTJApR4s,Shooohey,"Not in a sexual way, but their relationship is full of love. It&#39;s proof that they trust each other so much. It is sad to see this and interpret it in a sexual way. The masses are quick to make that connection, but it is too short-sighted. You can see that they are comfortable with each other&#39;s closeness in everything they do, including skinship, daily conversation and playing together. As well as their friendship, it is quite valuable and precious that they trust each other so much and get on so well with each other. Again and again, not in a sexual way, but their relationship is full of love."

My husband left me for another woman, This was just 3 years of our marriage. The most painful thing is that I was pregnant with our second baby. I wanted him back. I did everything within my reach to bring him back  but all was in vain, I wanted him back so badly because of the love I had for him, I begged him with everything, I made promises but he refused. I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back , I had no choice than to try it. I messaged the spell caster called dr vera segi, and he assured me there was no problem and that everything will be okay before 11 hours. He cast the spell and surprisingly 11 hours later my husband called me. I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said  was that he was so sorry for everything that had happened. He wanted me to return to him. He also said he loved me so much. I was so happy and went to him. That was how we started living together happily again.thanks to dr vera segi . If you are here and your Lover is turning you down, or your husband moved to another woman, do not cry anymore, contact Dr. Vera segi for help now..Here his contact, WhatsApp him: +2348051759674  email: verasegispells@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>"

pmIOrr25pOc,Dave Keller,Bowling machines feels much faster than actual bowlers. Because they don&#39;t have any run up and bowling action.  It feels like a CANON. I faced bowling machine at 110km/hr it felt faster than many fast bowlers.

sf2FYWPbBfo,rohit pratap,"Vaughny you need to get over your obsession with a pitch not being a good test pitch if Root gets 5 for 8. <br>If a Darren Stevens gets 5 for 8 on an early season Lords, noone calls it a bad pitch . Everyone just says batsmen can&#39;t play seam and swing. The same applies in India with spin. The Indian batsmen (most of whom don&#39;t play much ranji) found a way..."
sf2FYWPbBfo,Ajay Konathala,Warner is also not good these days. Australia needs two openers one would be puckowski and other player could  be Marcus Harris or Matthew Renshaw. <br><br>They have to persist with Travis head  at 5 he is a really good player.

sf2FYWPbBfo,Nikhil Verma,Where is the next episode? Isn&#39;t it due today?
sf2FYWPbBfo,Mr Kipling,We made big runs in one of the four test matches we just played in the India series and won that test so I agree with Michael Vaughan totally. We aren’t going to win the ashes without making big runs. 250-300 isn’t enough. Even 350 might not be enough. 400-450 even 500 is needed. We made 578 in the first innings of the first test in India and won the game quite comfortably. We need a lot more of that.
sf2FYWPbBfo,Mr Kipling,"More of these episodes please, this was brilliant!!"
sf2FYWPbBfo,Thomas Davis,"severe lack of in depth knoweledge of the England side in this podcast:<br>- Jack Leach is a very handy spinner<br>- No regard for ollie pope, who has a higher first-class average than all of these players<br>- No mention of Mark Wood, Olly Stone &amp; Ollie Robinson<br>- And Burns &amp; Sibley have shown their quality on many occassions"
sf2FYWPbBfo,AVANISH KUSHWAHA,"Come on JL don&#39;t tell a lie here , Indian team were not getting all facilities they were not given lift facilities in hotels , no hotel staffs , our Indian players were racially abused by your bloody spectators ..<br><br> Aussies still can&#39;t digest that India without their full strength beat Full strength Australia team ..<br><br>Aussie coaches speaks good things when they are in IPL but they just speak bitter things about Indian players"

sf2FYWPbBfo,Jitendra Prasad,"I reckon England should go with the same team again which they had in 2019-20 Ashes, with Jimmy Anderson included.<br>Crawley &amp; Sibley are not that much good players to be included in an Ashes team."
sf2FYWPbBfo,David,England will learn a lot from India&#39;s victory in Australia and feel like they are in with a chance.
sf2FYWPbBfo,Devious Pirate,Australia will win 3-1.
sf2FYWPbBfo,Football talk,We should play Pope at 3 he&#39;s playing well at 4 for surry and play foakes or bairstow in the middle order at 6
sf2FYWPbBfo,Srikanth Pokkunuri,@Fox Cricket - please post these videos regularly. There are good series ahead and its quite interesting to watch these analysis.

sf2FYWPbBfo,S K,"Very good discussion , keep posting frequently"
sf2FYWPbBfo,Deeptak Das,Lee cant say that ipl shouldnt continue. Bcci will  kick him out. He is talking like ipl is the only entertainment people can fall back upon
sf2FYWPbBfo,Mayuresh Mungekar,That&#39;s quality cricket content
sf2FYWPbBfo,Ashwin Srinivas,"@42.09 <br>Brendon, the pitches were not woeful instead, the technique on display by some of the English batters were really poor. <br><br>Vaughan might complain that the pitches spun in India, as if he was not aware that it will take turn at some point of time. Its due to the dry overhead conditions in two of the hottest cities in India.  It&#39;s like asking the ball not to swing in England or bounce in Australia. England were in the pole position in 3 test matches by winning the toss and choosing to bat first. <br><br>First learn to play spin before you tour India. Smith, Hayden, Amla and Cook were the four batsman who have had enormous success in India and the reason is they play spin on merit. <br><br>Sachin played against Pakistan in 1999 scoring 136 on one of the toughest wickets in Chennai and faced Saqlain who was probably the best off-spinner in the world at that time. Ask some of your players especially that upstart Labuschagne to learn playing spin otherwise the Australian team will dance to the tune of the Indian Spin trio - Ashwin, Jadeja and Axar in 2022"
sf2FYWPbBfo,Deep Ranjan Mukherjee,Michael Vaughan crying 😢 again English team was poor not the pitch
sf2FYWPbBfo,Akash mishra,Vaughan doesn&#39;t have any problem with Anderson or any other faster bowler taking all those wickets in a hurry on a seaming wickets.
sf2FYWPbBfo,Akash mishra,Well Vaughan will always have a problem with ahemdabad pitch where Joe Root has taken 5 for 8 but he never talks about out of those 5 wickets 3 one of those were of the in experienced player <br>And if a part time bowler or any bowlercan bowl the ball in the right area he could get a wicket
sf2FYWPbBfo,Vikram Aggarwal,"Except for the pink ball test pitch, all others were typical spinning Indian pitches. You guys seriously need to stop crying. SENA pitches are fast, bouncy, swing, sometimes are too green &amp; some have big cracks. Sub continental pitches spin, England did not complain once when they won against a weak Sri lankan team but the moment they came up against quality bowling and batting, they fell apart. Australia fearing the same have also started crying that the pitches were woeful and awfull. Better batsmen will solve this problem BJ, a couple more batsman of Mark Waugh’s quality or Steve Smith will do a world of good. Till then stop complaining, its boring."
sf2FYWPbBfo,Advait Dhamnaskar,England going to won the ashes this time.
sf2FYWPbBfo,Advait Dhamnaskar,"Mitchell starc , nathon lyon should be dropped  from the Australian side they are really looking ordinary in last couple of series."
sf2FYWPbBfo,Advait Dhamnaskar,"Australia will surely reach to the bottom of rankings in test cricket.  Untill tim paine is captain . In his captaincy Australia can&#39;t even imagine to win in overseas.  Also in his captaincy Australia lose to India both the times in home. England going to sweep aus in this ashes. Even steve smith,david warner are also now underperforming. Steve smith is weak against spin. Aus needs to find a new hero now. One thing is sure Australia&#39;s decline is begin after ind vs aus last series."
sf2FYWPbBfo,Andrew Wilkins,I feel like the 2021/22 ashes might be really exciting

sf2FYWPbBfo,Hari Randhawa,"I shouldn’t expect more from this bunch but I find it so irritating that ‘bad pitches’ are still being used as a scapegoat every time teams gets thrashed in India. Excessive spin conditions always gets blamed by the Western teams yet the narrative when Asian teams travel to Aus/Eng/NZ is that they cannot play swing, seam or bounce. Why the double standard? Vaughan says that it can’t be a good pitch when Root gets 5 for 8 but the same pundits were complaining that the 2nd test was also terrible pitch but then India scored 350 in the second innings."

sf2FYWPbBfo,Thomas Miles,About time @Fox Cricket gave the sport and its channel the attention it deserves with a show like this! Great work.

INCGRqXVLdw,Sat Matharu,"Aussie arrogance is breathtaking. Here you have Julian &amp; Waugh rubbishing England batting &amp; spinner and bigging up Warner (who is past his best) in the same breath. You would have thought after the beating India B team gave them on their own patch  they would have learned some humility. But no. Apart from Labuschagne &amp; Smith, aussie batting is not that great itself- they clearly have an unrealistic ego inflated opinion of themselves!"
INCGRqXVLdw,Danial Shah,Ollie Robinson and olly stone will be the main bowlers. And these 2 haven&#39;t been talked about at all
INCGRqXVLdw,Deepak Sharma,Michael Vaughan doesn’t have any idea. England gonna loose Ashes.
INCGRqXVLdw,Ameya Palav,Mark waugh i have to say England got better batsman than the Aussies. Australia only has Smith and Labuschane. Warner is done with cricket. And yes Brendon Jullien you hardly played a test match. Watch your mouth before you criticize indian pitches. This why Australian cricket has gone doqn over the years. They need to give the job to Ricky Ponting who is a proper coach. Justine Langer is too busy with amazon prime. Sorry JL no disrespect. India and New zeland are the two best sides. Michael vaughn shove his opinion where the sun doesnt shine.

INCGRqXVLdw,J Rudresh,Michael Vaughan... You need woakes or a donkey spinner to bowl those overs. Archer is a specialist ..  get him to bowl no more than 12 overs at full tilt in shirt spells of 3..4 overs. He&#39;ll take your wickets while the bowler from the ithe rend should create an equal amount of pressure. That&#39;s how Johnson made merry a few ashes back.

INCGRqXVLdw,SredniVashtar,"They are obsessed with the speed gun when it comes to Archer. He isn&#39;t just about pace and it&#39;s unrealistic to expect him to be consistently above 90mph. If you&#39;re going to use him like that then he&#39;s not going to bowl more than 3-4 over bursts, spaced widely apart. I&#39;m sure the great fast bowlers of the past weren&#39;t under so much pressure to bowl flat out all the time. Or, if they were, they ended up injured."

Then they should have Johnny Bairstow in at 3..followed up by Root, Stokes and Buttler in at 4,5,6..in at 7 they should go with Chris Woakes.. Then.. Jofra Archer, Stuart Broad, Mark wood and James Anderson should be playing at 8,9,10,11..This is a gamble.. But if it clicked.. England can blow away Australia in their own backyard... I mean.. You just have Broad and Anderson with the New ball.. Pace of Archer and Wood... And also the Allround abilities of Stokes and Woakes.. And with Moeen at the top.. You also have a spinner.. 😌"

INCGRqXVLdw,Ferdi_GM84,"I think Englands team now is alot stronger than it was in 2017/19 so if they can stop smith and labuschagne they have a chance. If you look at the India series to start with they had a hold on Smith and the Aussies could barely get to 200. England have tallents like Lawrence who batted well in India for his 40 and 50, Pope hopefully will get runs, Crawley and Sibley are the openers for me Sibley is playing a Pujara role by just wearing down the bowlers and Crawley can play more freely then,Buttler, Stokes and Root are Englands best batters and they&#39;ll have to perform. England have a great bowling group, though people say the same about Australia&#39;s but in that India series Starc and Lyon struggled. Cummins is obviously world class along with Hazlewood"

QhXNQgTOX60,shikhar govil,imagine steven smith in place of marnus. the situation would have been really awkward.
QhXNQgTOX60,xXALLIGATORXx zz,I really like his initial movement tbh. The left foot is pointing towards the bowler just like kallis back in the day. My coach taught me the same and it works very well especially for the ball that nips back in . The straight drive and on drive come on nicely

lFck_Oad5V4,Jessy Thomas,Kerry Okeefe should be doing commentary.
lFck_Oad5V4,Ben Hewitt,Trevor Bayliss is a terrible coach for SRH.  They have a strong squad each year and manage to lose strings of matches that were unloseable.
lFck_Oad5V4,Tariq Sheikh,Joker vogue is everywhere come back to Indian audience when troll fuel fade away
lFck_Oad5V4,Tariq Sheikh,O poor cricket they compare ipl to Ashes to remote ashes.
lFck_Oad5V4,Grab positive,Warner is incredibly famous in india 👍
lFck_Oad5V4,Dattaraj Korgaonkar,You guys spoke all nonsense for 7fking minutes and spoke like 30secs on Warner wtf !
lFck_Oad5V4,pulser60,Warner gonna be the new captain for ipl Kerala team in 2022
lFck_Oad5V4,Sanjeev Tiwari,Kerry O&#39;keeffe is a real fun bloke! I would love to drink couple of beers with him and just talk.
lFck_Oad5V4,Amar Maestro,Management?? I will give my piece of my mind to the management once I get a chance to meet then. Dropping Warner!? How ridiculous? We need the efforts of the team to win the matches but we need Warner in the playing squad for us to cheer for Sunrisers Hyderabad.
lFck_Oad5V4,Development !,Before this video I thought only Aakash Chopra believes IPL is possible later this year .
lFck_Oad5V4,Devashish Sonowal,"RCB would take it eventually, can&#39;t wait ....."
lFck_Oad5V4,Kidzu for Kids,"came for Warner, u gave just a glimpse, Still happy as we in India Love him &amp;  Kane a lot."
lFck_Oad5V4,shijooos,Indian players in SRH was the major reason for defeat and the stupids sack Warner. The worst decision ever. They should get rid of the 3D players and take some good local talent.
lFck_Oad5V4,CFL,IPL 2021 can be (completed) held in September in England or UAE<br>Or in November in New Zealand or UAE after the T20I World Cup
lFck_Oad5V4,CFL,2021 T20I World Cup should be held in Australia as per original schedule <br>The 2022 T20I World Cup can be held in India
lFck_Oad5V4,Dhawal,"SRH should have taken him into confidence, they don&#39;t deserve him! I hope RCB or DC gets him next year."
lFck_Oad5V4,calvinbonjovi,Geez guys it&#39;s not &quot;Maldaives&quot; ! Just bcoz they have scuba diving there doesnt mean it&#39;s mal-dives as in scuba dives! It&#39;s pronounced mauldeevs!
lFck_Oad5V4,Ashwin Raj,Warner should.kick srh...Bloody ungrateful people
lFck_Oad5V4,Shinod BM,Warner discussion happens right at the end of the video 😔
lFck_Oad5V4,Josh Galloway,"Can we please not have significant proportions of each podcast taking about COVID. It’s all over the news daily which covers everything that’s discussed here, but there’s no point in saying that cricket is a way for fans to escape COVID and switch off for a few hours, yet spend so much time talking about it and going over the same lines of “bubbles, quarantine, isolation etc.” Fans want to hear your expert panellists talk about the game, not COVID over and over again. Apart from that, great podcast."
lFck_Oad5V4,Ayush FF 8055,2 min silence for people who died due to coronavirus 😔🙏
lFck_Oad5V4,Pranav Chavan,What&#39;s happened to okaffee
lFck_Oad5V4,Nimish Bachu,"If he handled it with class, then why the hell was he seen crying on the boundary line. And if you needed a different spark, why the hell do you drop him from the playing XI? I Swear SRH has the worst management in the history of sports"

jZ2qmkGp8z4,Tushar Chatterjee,"Brilliant logic, Kerry! I agree. <br><br>Now, let&#39;s do the same for 2007-08 when blatant cheating won Australia the series. Furthermore, let&#39;s also apply DRS for all the earlier series."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,peeyush bhambhu,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ2qmkGp8z4&amp;t=48m56s"">48:56</a> huges getting toilet paper hahahahha"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Abhi Chakra,Yeah right!!! If india weren&#39;t bowled out for 36 result would have been different!3-0. Grow up!!!
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Sarvesh,Paine dropped and missed stumping chances of pant 3 times at the SCG. He also missed the stumping chance of pant at the gabba. If these chances were taken aus would have won the final 2 tests. India played really well at MCG showed character through out the series without kohli. Australia never played like Australia they used to play they let the key moments slip through their hands and allowed India to come back into the game Shardul-Sundar partnership was the example. More than the drop catches that&#39;s where I felt they lost the game.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Sam roy,i knew this was gonna be fun
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Sangram Ray,The Indian side too dropped many catches !!
jZ2qmkGp8z4,KingKane,"&quot;If you held your catches you guys would have won the series 3-1&quot; Yeah if India would have won all the games then India would have won the series 4-0. Man, cricket pundits can be so mind numbing stupid at time. These &#39;if&#39; scenarios can be narrated anyway you want."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,FRANK,"Had india not dropped those catches at the oval, scorecard would have read 3-0 , Mr. Keefe😂"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,PRASHANT MAKWANA,How many ODI and T20 against NZ and SL in white ball cricket in summer?
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Amit Sethi,"Cry babies.... none of those catches looked easy. At this rate, you would think, India did not miss any chances. Accept it, you have been beaten now back to back twice by India - beaten by a better team....."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,amey nichal,If aus hadn’t dropped catches ..if they scored more centuries..if they took more wickets ..like wtf kerry ..first u commentate without learning the players names ..now this crap..what if ind held onto all catches especially the Rahane one which was a sitter and marnus got a 100..if there wasn’t such hard quarantine with bad hotels for India..if there weren’t so many injuries to India ...if ind had won a single toss in the last 3 matches ...if India did not have to bat last in last 3 matches ..if Siraj wasn’t mentally abused ..if ifs and buts were fruits and nuts the world wouldn’t be such a hungry place brother ...be a gracious loser ..you had all possible advantage and you simply lost to people who had a stronger will and incredible resilience..the better team won
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Arshad sharif shaheed,"Warne, Akram, Tendulkar, Lara, and S. waugh... best cricketers in the 90s in that order"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Robeson,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ2qmkGp8z4&amp;t=14m48s"">14:48</a> - basically: &quot;if Australia was a better cricket team they would have won easily&quot;. Idiots still drinking so much copium 🤣"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Robeson,That turd Vaughan needs to shut his cakehole. Moron.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Amit Kolachina,"so funny,india dropped much more than how much aus did ."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Debjit Ghorai,No expectation because the had a great lose against youg India and don&#39;t call this Vaughan he is a great lier
jZ2qmkGp8z4,ribhu deo,O boy! O&#39;Keeve still can&#39;t gulp down loss to India. Get over mate move on.. btw no mention saying that catches are part of the game and one team loses only when they play not good enough cricket as compared to the other team. It&#39;s that simple mate..
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Ethan,Watched both of these now. Much preferred listening to what Steve had to say than his brother.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Ghanshyam Kathwadia,"why dont they accept that they had beaten by the WORLDS GREATEST SIDE , aussie  have excecusses  in their nose they inhale or exhale everything is filled with excuses."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,prashant Constantine,What about India we also dropped lot more catches then u n had we taken could end up 4 - 0 in India&#39;s favor
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Green Goblin,"I don&#39;t get these guys except Steve Waugh. They are so full of themselves. How do you take pride by thrashing visiting teams at home and performing terribly overseas yourself. Other than squaring 1-1 in 2018 in UAE what have you achieved, keeping in mind not winning an Ashes in England since 2001. They were even whitewashed 3-0 by Sri Lanka in 2016 along with being thrashed by Pak in UAE and then criticize Asian teams on their techniques when you yourself play spin so horribly. They need to come out of the fact that you are not the mighty Australian team of the 2000s who defeated India in India in 2004-5 series.<br>India also have a long way to go. They need to win series in SA, NZ and Eng as well to cement their dominance"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Ishan Mukhopadhyay,Steve Waugh. The best man to&#39;ve captained Australia. Period.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Kapil Dhungana,Why do Aussie find it tough to digest defeat and take excuses while they mention proudly about their victories?? It shows Aussies are coward  in inside!
jZ2qmkGp8z4,v s,tim paine has been appointed as captain for Australia womens national team...:-)
jZ2qmkGp8z4,v s,why so much hype.. eng will whitewash aussies. when you have a cry baby captain -tim paine. hoping this will be his last test series and retirement followed by
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Dipyaman Majumder,2021 great Test matches
jZ2qmkGp8z4,anurag kumar,Y the hell are the forgetting that INDIA has won 2 back to back series in Australia.... 2 back to back series...so its bttr they look into their mistakes rather than excuses....
jZ2qmkGp8z4,sasi gadde,"2018- No Warner and smith<br>2021- Catches were dropped<br>Aussies cannot admit that they have lost to a better team. Seems like they are still hangover in the previous era of Ponting lead Ausssie. To be honest,Aussie Test team bench is not strong enough. They couldn’t find an bowling option other than Lyon,Cummins,Hazlewood and Starc and still they don’t want to fix it."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,amey nichal,Kerry India dropped more catches at gabba..drop marnus and he got a hundred...if ind and aus has held all their catches aus would have been trounced 3-1
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Kolo 3,Excuse hi Agar batana hai...phir to 2008 series india umpiring blunder se haari...aur ye excuse bhi nahi hai...sure shot cheating thi....india wo series 2-1 se jeet jaati...<br>Nalla bhadva o&#39;Keefe buddha pagla gaya hai😂
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Anish Mehra,India dropped more catches than AUS..our fielding was pathetic to say the least ..had those chances been taken should have been 4/0 India even Adelaide 1st inng Aus got out of jail due to our drops
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Himanshu Chaudhary,But ashes is of 5 test how it is 6 test series 🤔
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Cat's eye reflex,If you want to make excuses.. India dropped tons of catches..Probably double that of Australia.. Had basically only 2 players from the main squad... Played 4 debutants in GABBA.. Aussies can&#39;t stop making excuses..
jZ2qmkGp8z4,RoSuperhit Sharma,"The hypocrisy that Australia would have won the series if they held on to their catches is amazing. Lol. India dropped your guys 13 times off Bumrah’s bowling only. Add in other bowlers, you would have been sweeped."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,O_O,brahhmiun quota people are responsible for covid19 pandemic .
jZ2qmkGp8z4,anshika dubey,evenings sorted with ipl
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Emamul Arfeen,As if India didn&#39;t drop any

jZ2qmkGp8z4,rakesh goel,Had hanuma vihari not been injured ind would  have won the series 3-1
jZ2qmkGp8z4,harry eromantic,Hii fox cricket...plz dont stop this podcast....loving it🥰🥰🥰
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Kp 07,Well india also missed lot of chances so i think that makes it all square
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Gaurav Yadav,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ2qmkGp8z4&amp;t=15m03s"">15:03</a>, is that guy idiot or what? India dropped more catches than Australia in Brisbane, 7 catches were dropped off bumrah&#39;s bowling alone in 3 matches that he played."
jZ2qmkGp8z4,bhavin pithawala,we could have won if we have not dropped those caches. lol
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Chirag Shetty,This is why Australia will keep losing in the future...u guys are operating on&quot; if &quot;...rather you guys should accept it and try to improve it...36 all out was an outlier whereas India outplayed Australia the coming three matches..
jZ2qmkGp8z4,The purple balls of Thanos,Trust Skull to turn a drab discussion into an entertaining one
jZ2qmkGp8z4,4MH19CS100 SUDARSHAN.K.H,Look at steve waugh.... He is not overconfident.... That&#39;s why that era of Australia was so dangerous bcoz they don&#39;t excuses like modern era of Australia.... Look kerry he is saying aus dropped many catches common India have more catches.... Tou guys giv excuse thats why u don&#39;t win ashes this year...
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Sandeep yadav,I think Aussie win 4-0 or 5-0 2021 ashes series.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,vikky,Love from INDIA 🇮🇳🙏
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Robin Singh,skull....if rahane had taken marnus&#39; catch off Saini it would have been a goner for the aussies right there.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Royal Dong,The Aussies never fail to come up with a new excuse everytime...
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Abinaya,"@<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ2qmkGp8z4&amp;t=15m03s"">15:03</a> .. seriously? India dropped so many catches as well lol. Saying that if aus took catches they would have won 3-1 loooool."

jZ2qmkGp8z4,ANAND SUMYT,Thanks fox cricket keep providing these insightful contents
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Dheerendra Singh,india drop marnus alone 10 times in series
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Ekansh Oberoi,kerry o keefe didnt watch the series well. India too dropped many catches watch the match carefully before commenting.
jZ2qmkGp8z4,I'm Kannadiga,IPL is like Food for so many Indians 🤷‍♂️🏏

jZ2qmkGp8z4,Bharat Thej,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ2qmkGp8z4&amp;t=14m53s"">14:53</a>. Even if india would have taken their catches, Australia would still go down. Labuschagne was dropped thrice in first test (leading scorer), and when dropped by rahane t in final test first innings when they just lost smith,"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Skylar UTD,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ2qmkGp8z4&amp;t=14m48s"">14:48</a> if buts and maybe lol no one s gonna remember ur drop catches. But history will remember how tim paine the loud mouth got spanked by India s C team"
jZ2qmkGp8z4,education World,Catches was dropped a lot by Indian fielder too 😂😂 don&#39;t come up with another excuse
jZ2qmkGp8z4,vi,Australia will win the ashes
jZ2qmkGp8z4,Ayush Mishra,I literally wish AUSTRALIA must win the ashes they deserve it they are extremely better side than England... 5-0 must be done.. England deserves to be crushed.. They don&#39;t deserve to win coz they haven&#39;t performed well... Smudge must punish the brit bowlers and Patty Cummins should destroy their Batting lineups.....
pBm10LZuugU,Me Myself,Guilty people always want to &quot;move on&quot; from their own misdeeds.
pBm10LZuugU,SSN Jan,Never again
pBm10LZuugU,Mick Kidd,You don&#39;t get second chances when you&#39;re captain of Australian the cricket team and get caught  cheating
pBm10LZuugU,RJ,This video feels like junior’s father video called him at work !!
pBm10LZuugU,RJ,Fast bowlers had no idea ball had been rubbed with sand paper ?? I will leave that to your conscience to believe it !!
pBm10LZuugU,Orgasmatron76,I don’t think Steve Smith can be captain again to be honest. Australia can not afford more bad publicity for the Australian Cricket Team. Marnus Labuschagne might be a chance down the line to be captain if his performances continue for another 20-30 tests. He might be around 30 then; more than likely it will be Pat Cummins who will Captain with Smith as the Vice Captain.
pBm10LZuugU,Shaane Alam,plz give him captaincy again
pBm10LZuugU,aamir kaleem,Every person need a second chance in life plz give him a second chance
pBm10LZuugU,p,If they will move on then everyone do the same.
pBm10LZuugU,Nomad,Bowlers being oblivious to that sly act is implausible.
pBm10LZuugU,Ricky Varghese,I will not prefer bowler  pat Cummins as captain. Cause they get frequent injuries..
pBm10LZuugU,Pramod R,"without bowlers knowledge this cannot happen for sure , but that does not mean bowlers asked for it"
pBm10LZuugU,N K,Keep getting Gower. He’s top
pBm10LZuugU,ATUL GURU,Hypocrite australia media
pBm10LZuugU,CLASH WITH SAHU,"Yeah I liked what he said at the end , pat Cummins captain and when he is rested , Smith will take over"
pBm10LZuugU,Arpan,Where&#39;s the full podcast?
pBm10LZuugU,Rubig Billoj,Marcus captian S
pBm10LZuugU,Harsha,"This sandpaper issue is bound to come up again in future and if that point in time Smith is the Australian captain , questions will be be asked of him again and how&#39;s he going to deal with it??<br>Surely he is not the person CA wants  facing the media."
pBm10LZuugU,HULKVARINE,Why can&#39;t Nathan Lyon be Captain
pBm10LZuugU,SK D,Why not give the captaincy to Marnus Labuschagne if not Smith and Warner? He is a regular in the squad and is doing exceptionally well as a batsman.
pBm10LZuugU,Sridhar P,"Ha ha move on. Aussies were known for integrity and intensity. But this Aussie team tried win by cheating. The turn had to come out and all the people involved need to be punished . South Africa &amp; India did this with match fixers, they never played for their respective countries. <br>Aussies should stand by this example and prove they still have integrity."
pBm10LZuugU,Tarun Ranjan,Yeah Steve did a mistake &amp; he repaid the entire Australia by winning them the Ashes In England. come one he deserves a second chance.
pBm10LZuugU,Glory of Steve Smith,Past can&#39;t be changed..It&#39;s done. Let&#39;s move away from sandpaper gate. Steve Smith should be made the captain. He showed complete dominance when he was the captain of aussie. At least he need to made the vice captain. Smith is a genius and genuine captain. Ashes at home is a good series to prove his captaincy.
pBm10LZuugU,prabhu53,"It is not a question of done and dusted. It is about the mental integrity of individuals. If the bowlers knew about it, integrity demands that they open out. If they are not involved, they should come back with a clear cut statement rather than brushing aside."
pBm10LZuugU,R V S,I hope Cummins is given captaincy. This would hopefully usher an era where bowlers are respected
pBm10LZuugU,SHERON_S_SHAH,"After this incident cricket aus take a worst disision in cricket history by emotional disision 😭 that&#39;s why aus lost 5-0 odi eng,2-1 india test😭😭"

pBm10LZuugU,Wave Flight Simulations,Get over it
ekHCteaBi9I,Max Dexter,Imran Khan had 40 wickets and more then 300 runs on the dead wickets of Pakistan. But he gets no mention because the western media is more powerful. Botham ordinary cricketer having a solitary series where he was at his peak. But OMG did he turn into a liability at the end of his career.

eP6OurR0jgU,Shibin Vinod,"IPL and other premier leagues should schedule their matches with proper time space. Its utterly ridiculous to see IPL going to happen in the UAE later down the end of the year and again the new season gonna start by 2022 March. So the quality of IPl championship is not that great as it is pretty evident that the game is  about the money rather than the cricket itself. International cricket is doing well, but I guess ICC should be more firm with BCCI regarding IPL interfering international matches."

If players are left out or &#39;punished&#39; they will simply take their talents to the IPL where they will be appreciated and rewarded.

f0zW8RMoS6I,mrm prm,"CA grabs 10 percent of IPL earnings of each Australian participant perhaps calling it as NOC charges to take part in IPL. No organizer of IPL forces any player to take part in it. Australian players also play 4 months of the year in English County Cricket and that too from much much before the first season of IPL was held before blaming IPL. This Warne  has played 7 years in English County Cricket for Hampshire from 2000-2007 surely remitting home a lot of the fat UK Pounds. Lot of members of Australia, West Indies, England and Pakistan played for Kerry Packer in late 70&#39;s in Supertests and WSC. Lillee-Marsh-Walters-Chappell brothers went to the extent of skipping national duty for the sake of playing in Supertests before Australia can blame IPL. It was the great Bob Simpson, Kim Hughes, Allan Border and the members of the then Indian teamwho gave topmost priority to playing for their nation above all. Yet Australia selected back the Australian members of Supertests and WSC."
f0zW8RMoS6I,david w,Aussie players running the show....downfall coming.

f0zW8RMoS6I,Ams S,"I concur I mean if I was a cricket player course use your talents to make money but not when it comes at the price of a test series for your country that’s the biggest honour and think themselves lucky of course it’s hard work and talent but they should consider it a gift to be playing sport for a living and representing your country in any sport, IPL has messed it up and if a test series or any international match happens during the IPL season then that international match should always take priority"
f0zW8RMoS6I,Syed Zaidi,"Playing for the country is an honor, which you can’t get by the Franchised cricket."

f0zW8RMoS6I,blasttrash,"if you &quot;punish&quot; people for playing IPL and not choose them for TEST, ODI etc, then you are not sending the best players and therefore international cricket will soon not be the pinnacle. Instead of punishing folks who play IPL, choose based on merit. that&#39;s the only way to keep international cricket at its pinnacle. Look at what happened to Faf(its not same situation but you get the point), he won t20 tournament in one of the best leagues (IPL) and yet wasn&#39;t chosen for t20 world cup(I am pretty sure he wasn&#39;t being punished, there are other reasons why he might not have been chosen, but the point about merit still stands coz SA got thrashed by Aus today in opener of t20 world cup)."
f0zW8RMoS6I,tottenham123mh,Wtf is Vaughn on about football teams pulling out?
f0zW8RMoS6I,Mr Handsome,Just give one month to franchise cricket and the rest of the year should be only enter national cricket.

f0zW8RMoS6I,Mat Vimat,Yes. Totally agree. Country should be priority. Franchise games should be secondary. That too a trashy format T20.

f0zW8RMoS6I,Prabha Dhakre,players want to play ipl because of same venue of wt20
f0zW8RMoS6I,Jackpot 7,100% Agree. There is vast difference between cricket and football Premier leagues. Formats like 100 and IPL T20 are cancer and Aids to Game call Cricket

f0zW8RMoS6I,daniel raj,"Steven Smith and labuschagne are not the players that IPL want....but players like Maxwell, Pat cummins... big impact players."
f0zW8RMoS6I,ShemiS,This is so true. IPL is all about money. IPL destroys talented players. And also a tactic to recognize hidden tactics used by foreign players by the Indian players and that’s the so called Indians win matches. There’s no special talent with kohli or rohit. IPL is a scam now. It’s time that the countries stop and bring a law and punish the ppl who go behind money. Blackmail them
f0zW8RMoS6I,Rashid,IPL should be banned.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Sahil Bhatia,"Watching again after a couple of months, look how things have unfolded"
f0zW8RMoS6I,Vinod,No one cares about the useless bilateral series of Odis and T20. Cricket will not economically improve playing those tournaments. Look at Football no and says we gonna prefer playing Nation.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Tushar Ankit,"You will loose to Ireland too 😂, Warne is jealous of there bank balance."
f0zW8RMoS6I,Sandeep Karan,They are right . Money is fine but playing for your country should be a priority . But the problem is cricket boards are also sucked into this IPL money.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Soumya S,Look at their face 😀 future of cricket is in India.
f0zW8RMoS6I,amit gokhale,all these discussing are just jealous...IPL will give players good practise on conditions before t20 wc..
f0zW8RMoS6I,NPS,What the problem in making money it&#39;s good for cricket just don&#39;t shedule any tournament at the time of ipl so players will not be in a difficult situation.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Tony,"Franchise cricket will give incentives to players from poorer boards to continue with cricket. Why would other countries try investing in cricket if they never profit from it? It&#39;s going to be a dying sport if hyper-patriotism gets in the way. Just compare MLB. Its growing in countries like Taiwan, Mexico , European countries even if they don&#39;t compete in the level as US and Japan. Management decisions shouldn&#39;t be taken from richer boards ex-players. They don&#39;t care as long as they gets paid for their two-bit ideas."
f0zW8RMoS6I,Sattu_Supari,"Without IPL, cricket is dead. <br>Other board should just get that in head. As economy of India grows in coming decades,IPL is only going to get bigger and bigger. <br>In coming years, it will churn more money than ICC tours and later ICC tournaments."

Any player who&#39;d rather play for money than that doesn&#39;t deserve it.<br><br>Frankly, there&#39;s too much cricket happening at the moment (so why the hell do they want to stick it in the Olympics?!), so players need to decide where the priority lies. If it doesn&#39;t lie with their national side, then the national side needs to consider where their priority lies. Is it with the players who see international matches as just another match, or with the player who&#39;d chop their left arm off for a chance to play for their national side. You gotta ask, who is more likely to put the extra effort in to try to stop the boundary, or push hard to turn the single into two, or the two runs into three?"
f0zW8RMoS6I,funny sv,these things not make sence to me bcz it happen due to covid players pullout due to quarantine they have to wear. in normal days all int cricket played in good manour
f0zW8RMoS6I,KING,There is something called contracts with franchise
f0zW8RMoS6I,Maku,BCCI and IPL has ruin world class international cricket matches for their governments hungry for money.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Prashant Kumar Jha H2176,Shane Warne is correct because a player gets his name by playing International Cricket <br>A player should give Their country the first priority <br>I also like IPL but they should give their country the first priority
f0zW8RMoS6I,Muthukumar N K,"Okay, Now I think Ganguly has to invite all national board for a meeting, explain them about the issue.. It&#39;s not just about individuals earning money.. Millions and Millions of cash involved, Sponsers, broadcasting rights, contracts(not just for players, there are several people whose livelihood is completely based on IPL), ground fees, etc etc...Now we have a pandemic and everyone must support each other and do some little adjustments...

f0zW8RMoS6I,Ian Betts,Ben Stokes is the same. Bet Stokes goes to the IPL after pulling out of test matches this summer.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Anthony Soul,They&#39;re right. And I think that&#39;s why players like ABD retired completely from playing for his national side.
f0zW8RMoS6I,Sohail Khan,BCCI making the world of cricket dance to their bhangra tune!

f0zW8RMoS6I,Greatnorth,All of them have been part of the system for too long to accept that it is changing. The future is franchise cricket with IPL as the biggest event whether you like it or not.  Soon it will be not just about money but the players will be exposed to higher level of competition and skill than regular international cricket

kj915gHIg0A,Andrew 357,Vaughan saying no one likes Malan well it takes one to know one no bugger like him either since he became a pundit anyway. Plus his hair transplant is failing badly.
kj915gHIg0A,Still Ill,"Is Silverwood up to the job and has Root passed his sell by date as Captain, England have been poor for a few years and will get battered in Australia after the way they treated Robinson they deserve nothing more. Perhaps after the Ashes we might see a new coach and captain and stop all the rotation nonsense, if they are playing too many tests and forms of cricket for greed there lies the answer."

kj915gHIg0A,Allan O.

kj915gHIg0A,The Movie Doctor,&quot;Are England any chance against India &amp; Australia?&quot;.... great sentence.
kj915gHIg0A,nishant,"The thing about Aussie cricketers is either its my way or the highway ! They have no appreciation or little regard for any other style of playing.. Mark Waugh to rip apart Sibley so bad was uncalled for. Sibley n Burns may have bit unorthodox stance but are effective and Sibley in particular a solid defensive player. Now I can imagine that they must not be rating Pujara at all or hate him, since he&#39;s also in a similar league. Primarily bats defensive and grinds the runs. Sibley played a very good 89 in opening test against India and in 1st test against NZ got some good runs. He is a stubborn batsman and difficult to get out once in.. Just that the current batting line up is very inconsistent. The Aussies are rating Crawley highly because he scores quickly and has some nice looking shots ,but hasn&#39;t done much besides his one innings of 267. So if you bat aggressively you are a good batsman otherwise not according to their logic!"
kj915gHIg0A,Aaron D'Souza,&quot;Couldn&#39;t even knock over the Kiwi&#39;s&quot; lol Aussies still don&#39;t rate us... we so need a rematch

kj915gHIg0A,Raj A,"I don&#39;t care about india vs England series. Coz it&#39;s a home series for england. But I love to watch Aussies hammering england 5-0, then only ECB and Vaughan understands except root and Ben everyone in england team is not that good. They refuses to accept the fact. Either they blame the pitch or the rotation policy. Still no proper spinner, no solid opener after cook, no middle order stability in the team. I mean they are backing Anderson at the age of 39 but they refusing to play a spinner, even it&#39;s a swinging conditions spinner inclusion is priceless in test matches."
kj915gHIg0A,hemant ailani,👍
kj915gHIg0A,Manoj Dokku,But in India vs Australia series<br>Aus didn&#39;t rotate their pacers ... And by the last day of the last test ... They were pretty worn out ... Actually thats why india won ..<br>We were forced to replace the existing bowlers ... Which turned out to be great ... They had fresh legs .. so they were aggressive ...

kj915gHIg0A,hannibalking86,The so called ‘big 3’ all havethis issue
kj915gHIg0A,Daniel H,"Painful to listen to them praise players like Vince and Crawley just because they’re pleasing on the eye then stamp all over Sibley and Burns who got a 100 and an 80 against NZ. Imo opening in test cricket is about grinding down the bowlers over time not the “put pressure on them” nonsense that Warne talks about, and don’t get me started on him thinking Bairstow should be playing test cricket 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
kj915gHIg0A,The Attachment,England needs to go back to the team they had 4 years ago. All those players are perfect test players. Wtf is a rotation policy. Why can&#39;t an international cricketers play 5 match test series?
kj915gHIg0A,ವಚನ್ ಎಮ್,i thought this video was a little harsh on the players
kj915gHIg0A,Gwill,"Sibley is 25, averages 40 in FC cricket and has scored 15 100s, 2 in Tests (one in South Africa on a fast pitch). Meanwhile Burns averages 43 in FC, and has already got 100 vs Aus in 2019. These guys are as good as there is in county cricket at the moment, but these Aussies want England to dump them 5 games before the Ashes lol. Makes me laugh Vaughan championing Malan. The guy is 33 and scored 100 vs Aus on a flat Perth pitch and averages 27 in Tests. You really think he&#39;s the answer? He scored 199 in the CC last month against the worst club in the country and suddenly Vaughan thinks he&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread.<br><br>England are a poor team because the ECB have crammed white ball cricket into high summer, thereby forcing the County Championship to the margins of the season. Good luck averaging over 40 or learning how to build hundreds or play/bowl spin on a green top in April/May and September. England need to take a leaf out of NZ&#39;s book: prepare flat pitches to encourage hard work in batting and bowling, and don&#39;t overdo the white ball stuff."
kj915gHIg0A,Pawan Raj,Michael waughn most dumb player
kj915gHIg0A,Beckil Louise,"Its Joe Roots little gang, THATS why several players are in who shouldnt be anywhere near Test cricket. Also Root is a very poor captain . Totally reactive and never see him actually firing the team up.  Buttler should be captain. Bairstow should open with Crawley"
kj915gHIg0A,Last Man Standing,<b>Idk how easy or tough it can be as a player to listen to these ex player comments. Warnie said why Bairstow isn&#39;t playing he is extremely great player ?🤷🏻‍♂️ 🙄 Did he forget Bairstow scored more ducks than total innings in match. Bairstow had no idea where the ball was coming from and going to. Sibley bats like proper test players I cnt believe they criticized him</b>

kj915gHIg0A,shubham zone,"Indian bolling was horrific,no bounser,no yorker.......very sad"
kj915gHIg0A,Ashir Intishar,"I can&#39;t agree on the Sibley point made by Warne and Mark. That was an overstatement to say Sibley is not good enough to play test cricket. If you look at the current English test squad, Sibley has performed much better than most others. He is a tough nut to crack and had been resilient under pressure, with already some crucial knocks early in his career. He  is a player who can play long innings by being patient for long periods against quality bowling, which is the most important attribute in test cricket. Every now and then, when you play against a quality bowling lineup like New Zealand in overcast swinging conditions, you would have some failures. He already got test hundreds in South Africa and India, which proves he can definitely play."
kj915gHIg0A,Tim charles,"The reason England did not chase 270 at Lords against New Zealand is because they knew the batting lacked depth and class and were over dependent on Root (by the second test his form had suffered and he was also dropping catches). Indeed, they only escaped with a draw because of time lost to the weather."
kj915gHIg0A,kunal verma,Jhony Bairstow? Seriously warnie?
kj915gHIg0A,Naveen Kushalappa,I think Sibleys style suits Australia pitches especially Kookaburra balls. Wear out the bowling for the initial overs till the shine is gone then others can capitalise. Like how Pujara did in last 2 tours of Australia.
kj915gHIg0A,Madhav Natarajan,"i think waugh is being too harsh and its uncalled for. Burns and Sibley can tire out a set of bowlers for the rest of the batsmen to come. He just wants everybody to hit sixes and fours and maintain a SR of over 100, which is not ideal if the conditions are challenging"
kj915gHIg0A,Tynan Menezes,"Nobody slams England better than the great Warnie, he does it for a hobby!"

n6xz1AYVklg,Rony Kabir,Let&#39;s talk about Smith the CHEAT
n6xz1AYVklg,Doctor Joy,Venkatesh Prasad on twitter yesterday: &quot;Deepak Chahar was rejected by Greg Chappell at RCA for his height and told to look at a different occupation.

n6xz1AYVklg,gautham kr,Even if he is ready I doubt they would play him in playing11 in t20 he is underperformer in t20
n6xz1AYVklg,AstraBoi _Gramn,Smith was impressive leading RPS team in 2017. He batted really well that season too
n6xz1AYVklg,G Play,NZ will win the World T20. Glenn Phillips will be player of the tournament.<br><br>I&#39;d make Labuschagne the test captain for Australia.
n6xz1AYVklg,cricket update with mohsin raza,Smiith captain test cricket is very good for Australia
n6xz1AYVklg,Dio Brando,"Yah he shouldn&#39;t play, T20 needs six hitters, Smith is not one of those."
n6xz1AYVklg,Kevin Menezes,"Besides the quartet of Hazlewood, Starc Cummins and Lyon, what options does Australia have ?? <br>An injury to any of the trio, will send shivers down Paines spine. Besides Jamess Pattinson, Tim hasn&#39;t tried to bring in any new pacers. Neser has been travelling with the side for years now, carrying drinks"
n6xz1AYVklg,B M,Hey Greg Chappel long time. Still being stupid or any change 😂😂
n6xz1AYVklg,@Aabeeskaar,I think smith should be given captaincy without debate. He is one and only best one to fit that position. Looking at t20 I think aussies should not focus on test player in t20 as they have lot of weapons in arsenal. Inglish is still waiting for chance meredith jhye kane tye are already in line so it would be better if there would  be only few player to play all 3 formats.<br>this would not only help to manage workload of players but also give opportunity to new ones
n6xz1AYVklg,Wajahath Ahmed,Smith will probably be well and ready to go for T20 WC because there are more than 3 months for T20 WC and that is a lot of time to recover from a Elbow injury 🤞
n6xz1AYVklg,Atharva Hodage,Steve Smith is a Genius Captain and if Aussies want to break their loosing streak Smudge should be given the captaincy
n6xz1AYVklg,Tom,T20 cricket RUINING batting techniques is such an old fashioned silly thing to say
n6xz1AYVklg,Shalini Balagopal,Smith is more important in tests than the t20. So it’s not a bad decision for him to rest during the t20i World Cup.
n6xz1AYVklg,Shalini Balagopal,I will give a 1% chance to England in the Ashes as long as Tim Paine is captain.
n6xz1AYVklg,Sahil Singh,With the coming of t20 cricket the Australian Summer has become more crowded. The Sheffield Shield and other First Class Cricket Should be played and done with before Summer starts in Australia so that players don&#39;t have to prioritise one format over others.
n6xz1AYVklg,G R,World cup is as important as the ashes
n6xz1AYVklg,Pratik Talk,Why Marnus Labuschagne is not a part of t-20 squad? he looks pretty special player
n6xz1AYVklg,Mr.Loveleen Ruhela,"Australia win ashes and Mitchell Starc form is back because Starc said I am ready to ashes and 5 matches played in these stadium <br>SCG,Adelaide,gabba,mcg and waca<br>Starc take 46 wts in day night <br>I think Starc is ready to ashes he said"
n6xz1AYVklg,duffy,Steve smith should be captain and and opener perfect role for him

2MVgzptK9qA,Joel Uyir,Aus Vs Wi 1st ODI highlights?
2MVgzptK9qA,Arjun Mishra,I guess its time for Australians to accept that most of their players arent what australian culture and heritage really is. I wont be surprised if Eng beat them at home if Marnus and Smith dont fire.
2MVgzptK9qA,Jasmeet Singh,Toooo short. Seems very rushed. Bring back the OG longer version guys!!

2MVgzptK9qA,Jonathan Bronn,Wondering: Why is Nathan Lyon never considered for the captaincy of the Australian test side?
2MVgzptK9qA,Ian Cosgrove,"As a neutral Kiwi I think the ashes will be 4-0/5-0 to Aussie, English quicks Anderson and Broad not so effective on away tours and the batting besides Root and Stokes is poor"
2MVgzptK9qA,Zubair Khan,Greg Chappell was great cricketer
2MVgzptK9qA,Men in Blue,"Forget Tim Paine as captain, he wouldn&#39;t make it to a 15 member squad of even any domestic squad anywhere in the world."

P7BkIa3l-a0,Tutul,England&#39;s top 3 is a concern for the team. Everytime you can&#39;t expect root to come to the rescue.England really need to dig deep into their selection mandate and they have to pick their best eleven and also stick with it. You cannot keep chopping and changing too much with your batting line up. It affects the players confidence

P7BkIa3l-a0,Frank Ford,"Uh, one guy averaging nearly 50 and five guys averaging 30! Just a shocking pile of utter shite. Atherton, Hussain, Gatting, Lamb, and Botham would walk in to the batting and none of them average 40. No excuses, the batting outside Root is pathetic! Stokes is one of our best bats averaging what 35? NZ have three guys over 40 and a keeper around 35. England are simply pants! They cannot bat even in England."

P7BkIa3l-a0,Hasan Matloob,"Sorry but I don&#39;t agree with Atherton when he just shrugs off spin. Having a quality spinner is crucial in Australia. No away side has ever won a series in Australia without having quality spinner. England themselves won 2011 Ashes on the back of Graeme Swann&#39;s brilliance. England has missed a trick here by not developing any spinners. Mason Crane played the last Ashes Test in 2017 series and looked good. Where is he now??? In 4 years time, England has not managed to develop a single spinner on long term basis. Dom Bess and Jack Leech got exposed in India. They are going to lose the Ashes in Australia cuz of lack of quality spin options."

P7BkIa3l-a0,kartik kantheti,"If you want grafters as an opener, it would be a choice between Sibley and Hameed. Burns has done enough to warrant a place for this series. Crawley will get a number 3 go atleast for the first 2 test matches. You then have Root at 4. Stokes at 5. Now number 6 would be between Pope and Lawrence. Pope is a bit overrated in my opinion. Better to have Lawrence at 6. And then butler at 7."

lTUDwDtBshk,S Singh,"England won 1st test match Vs India because the pitch for first test match played flat in the first two days and then it deteriorated too much. <br><br>Rest all other pitches were spinning from day 1, therefore equal opportunities for  all batsmen  without any advantages as it was in 1st test in Chennai for first two days in 1st match where England got lucky and won the match."
lTUDwDtBshk,Rohit phulpagar,We are England cricket
lTUDwDtBshk,Anish Padhye,"Rory Burns played pretty well by scoring a stubborn century 132(297 balls) at Lord&#39;s and followed it with 80 odd runs at Edgbaston. But Sibely and Crawley disappointed in bulks to the English cricket fans. Especially Crawley if you put aside Dom Sibely&#39;s match saving 61* in the 1st Test. And as Nasser Hussain said after the series that these are the lads scoring monumentally in County cricket but as a whole lack consistency in international cricket. But now with the Ashes on the line, the top 3 need to reinvent their techniques( Burns and his inswing woes, Sibely&#39;s idiosyncratic stance and Crawley&#39;s outside off incapabilities) as the Australian pace trio is absolutely lethal in all 3 aspects. While  Joe Root&#39;s WTC campaign was a classy touche to Test cricket, his fluctuating Ashes form seems to be a worry. But he&#39;s the English captain!! Glory lies within him!! Ben Stokes is hero... The ASHES HERO, the HEADINGLEY HERO!! Spellbound by such men!! <br><br>And Australia at home are absolutely formidable!! Steve Smith is a beast in Australia(all over the world) and Ashes is his festival!! His 110.74 Ashes 2019 average answers it all... Marnus Labuschagne is still on a honeymoon with his baggy green cap and to his luck, an in-form India series and some handy knocks in County cricket would boost his confidence... While Tim Paine&#39;s captaincy and his keeping are exclusive in style, Australia would expect more from the bats of Paine and Matthew Wade...<br><br>As batsmen both the teams worship Test cricket as devotees, a high octane Ashes 2021 is predicted with the bat with the red Kookabura cherry and the Adelaide pink ball in the hands of world-class pacers. And as far as investing in young FC heroes is concerned, I prefer Haseeb Hameed to open with Burns and live up to his reputation as Baby Boycott. And I also opt for a talented Will Pucovski to leave his concussion fate behind and open with Warner."
lTUDwDtBshk,Rahul Menon,Such interesting analysis 👍
lTUDwDtBshk,Rahul Menon,England continue to persist with batsmen like Sibley and Pope who haven&#39;t scored runs for the last 2 series. Very lucky guys they are 🤔
lTUDwDtBshk,absolutely genius,England are hope of winning against Australia. But they don&#39;t know they are going to lose against India 😂😂

lTUDwDtBshk,arpan bera,Nathan Lyon could be x factor for Australia....stokes alws struggle against good off spinner like aswin..Lyon can take stokes wicket...if its turning a bit English batsman can struggle....england have good pace attack for bouncy track unlike 2016....they have archer woakes..stones...anderson now performing well in overseas..he did well in india and shrilanka......stones have good pace......if pitch asist spinner Lyon can destroy england.....yess he was failed against india. But that&#39;s don&#39;t matter...India alws best team against spin......
lTUDwDtBshk,SD Pearshaped,Please replace Mark Waugh with someone else like Ricky Ponting or Adam Gilchrist.
lTUDwDtBshk,Amiy Shrivastava,Joe Root and Ben Stokes have to come good as Batters if England are to Perform well in the Ashes Down Under.<br>Both have to score 500+ runs each and score a few centuries in between them to give Australia a tough fight.
lTUDwDtBshk,Amiy Shrivastava,1997 was probably the only realistic chance of England winning the Ashes in the 90&#39;s.<br>They were absolutely blown away in all the other series played from 1989-2001.
lTUDwDtBshk,subham nayak,The greatest cricket writer and broadcaster of this generation
lTUDwDtBshk,Rajesh Raghavan,Rope in Nasser soon
lTUDwDtBshk,Brett Bradley,While its nice to reminisce - how are Austraila going to build a top 4 against the engish bowlers?
lTUDwDtBshk,PK,Smith has been the top scorer (including 2 man of the series awards) in the last 3 Ashes series which includes 2 series in England. He failed terribly in the first 2 Tests against IND and scored some runs in the last 2 games but AUS lost both the games! He&#39;d be hungry to score some runs and regain his No.1 rank

If Botham can win the 1981 Ashes, Flintoff can win the 2005 Ashes; So why not Stokes this time ??? ..... Australia will be miles ahead of England on paper in terms of the team combination, home record &amp; also England&#39;s poor performance in the last two Ashes in Australia......But it should be always remembered that the game of cricket is played on the field not on paper.... India&#39;s astonishing series win over Australia earlier this year is a prime example.....So the Aussies are definitely the favourites to win the Ashes this time but I won&#39;t be surprised if England wins provided their key players are fit &amp; fine to play"

If India played two test series then both the AUS series and ENG series at home finished 1-1. Not that impressive eh? NZ only get two test series, none of this four or five tests. Probably why they beat both England and India. England have been saved by the rain TWICE this home season."

faoTxcOCbKg,midnightalchemist2,"Sure, but NZ still are the World Test Champs. Number #1 team in tests in the world. Well deserved. Will be interesting to see if India can step up to match them in future as they get better."
faoTxcOCbKg,Oleg Gorky,Really?  This is the weakest England team in years and they almost screwed it up.  In South Africa and Pakistan they won&#39;t have generous bowlers who will give them 120 runs for the eighth or nine wickets.  New Zealand soon saw them off and they&#39;re only a nation of about four and a half million.
faoTxcOCbKg,Devansh Pandey,Indian team breaks English team physically and Aussies are famous for breaking mentally.
faoTxcOCbKg,AnubisGod,no test team is special right now. This india team wouldnt be able to beat a 5th ranked team from 2012. The overall quality of test cricket is very meh atm
faoTxcOCbKg,Atharva Mahale,One of the main reasons our team is successful in overseas test matches is because of our fast bowlers and their well utilisation by the captain. Dhoni was a good captain in tests but he was slightly towards favouring spin bowlers and that&#39;s why when they made green pitches in SENA countries our pacers struggled and the team as well struggled. Kohli on other hand supports fast bowlers like hell.
faoTxcOCbKg,Wk Schwenke,They recently lost to New Zealand 🤔🤦‍♂️

faoTxcOCbKg,Prashantkumar@vizag,Seriously after watching this series now I  can proudly  say  that Test cricket 🏏 is a real war.....
faoTxcOCbKg,Amit KP,"What special?  in the morning of 5th day they were looking down the barrel of defeat when &quot;very unlikely&quot; batting by Shami and Bumrah got them the lead.  Batting depleted England could not hold on, although credit to Indian bowlers that most of the wickets were taken on good balls i.e. wickets were not thrown away by England.  Another point to consider is England side is without Stokes and Jofra Archer, two world class players.  Guess Karma did the balance as first test India should have won but was denied by the rain, so luck sided with them and got the victory on the second test.  Btw, Robinson and Siraj seem to have good future ahead of them as leading bowlers of their sides."

David warner score 95 runs in last ashes. Khawja, haris, burns r not so good with bat. Only smith and labuschagne keep pushing forward. Australia Captain doesn&#39;t hits a single century, and England captain gets already 22 and avg over 50. <br>Bowling department: Aus has trio England has a legendary duo and both teams has serious pace attack. <br>England suffering with their batter and Australia too.<br>The only difference is England loves experiment."

faoTxcOCbKg,Samiah Khanam,"The majestic Sarkar forgot to bat, scoring twelve runs in four matches in the T20 series against Australia?<br>2, 0, 2, 6 - Such is the run of the majestic government in four matches against Australia. Many cricket fans say that Soumya has been out in every match against Australia as if he forgot to bat. Nazmul Abedin Fahim, the mentor of Bangladesh&#39;s senior cricketers, says that the reason for this batting display of the majestic government is stress. The coach, who has been coached at various levels, said that the failure of the majestic government is on his mind and he cannot get out of it.Just before the Australia series, Soumya Sarkar was a regular performer in the T20 format. Soumya Sarkar scored two important runs in two matches on the T20 tour of India in 2019. He played an innings of 51 off 26 balls on New Zealand soil this year. The drink is gentle. The majestic Sarkar forgot to bat as soon as he started batting against Australia. In the first match, Australian fast bowler Josh Hazlewood hit the ball along the body when the majestic moved away and hit the ball, he cut the ball in that line and took it to the stumps, the result was bowled out. In the second match, the majestic Sarkar missed Mitchell Starc&#39;s ball <a href=""http://line.in/"">line.In</a> the third game, he could have gone back without a run, hitting the leg side shot, the fielder inside the 30 yard circle jumped and touched but could not catch, but he could not use this &#39;life&#39;. He returned to the dressing room after falling into the trap of the leg before the wicket, he missed the line to sweep the ball coming to the top of the pitch. In the fourth match, Soumya Sarkar got the ball in his place and got out. Josh Hazlewood&#39;s short ball was picked up on the leg side and hit, but the ball went off and was caught inside the ball circle. There are more questions about the type of out than being out, even in four consecutive matches."

hw0DyGdUPE8,sold out for jesus,As much as I hate kohli I love the way he gave it to the barmy army&#39;s  English fans always cry about something.
hw0DyGdUPE8,Ravindranath reddy,This is very ill from fox they use Kohli for branding of Ind vs aus and they talk nonsense on him when he is not in aus and then conduct a show to prove themselves wrong
hw0DyGdUPE8,Regdu Geht,Micheal Vaughan is such a good sport Also he is real fun to listen to
hw0DyGdUPE8,Harish Sivaramakrishnan,"Here&#39;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They&#39;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can&#39;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.<br><br>Like if you think it fits Virat Kohli. <br>Comment if you think it’s Joe Root."
hw0DyGdUPE8,Harish Sivaramakrishnan,I love Vaughan!
hw0DyGdUPE8,Harish Sivaramakrishnan,"Joe is boosting his career records.<br>Virat is boosting his captaincy records.<br>Simple as that.<br>In the end, you know what matters."
hw0DyGdUPE8,Harish Sivaramakrishnan,Glad you brought up Ashwin. Yes he is the man!
hw0DyGdUPE8,Karan Haridaass,Look at all us Indians applauding Vaughn just because he said nice things about us here. I remember we were baying for his blood when he put that Indian pitch picture on his Twitter. Oh we are a fickle bunch
hw0DyGdUPE8,90's kid,Absolutely correct. You and the english team who were complaining about Indian pitches are surely boring as hell 😎
hw0DyGdUPE8,Arindam Ghosal,Is this the same media portal who criticised Kohli for this celebration?
hw0DyGdUPE8,Sudhendu Gupte,Micheal Vaughan has agreed that India is the second best of the world and India is much fun to add fun to the game thanks. LOL.
hw0DyGdUPE8,Niladisify,Those who complain are sore butt hurt people.
hw0DyGdUPE8,Raoim,He will remind you  80&#39;s and 90&#39;s top cricketer of top team of that era and to his haters he really care for you ! No he doesn&#39;t 😂
hw0DyGdUPE8,Mano mantra,Michael Vaughan is a Useless Character.
hw0DyGdUPE8,Huhu Haha,"In a world of cookie-cut, PR trained, diplomat interview we need someone like Kohli, Roy Keane to make things interesting. <br>Every interview is the same boring $h¡Te."
hw0DyGdUPE8,HaSsy M,"Indian fans are double standard as ever. If this was someone else from subcontinent doing it, they&#39;ll have dig at calling him all sorts. But, it&#39;s Kohli, so he can do whatever even dance n.ked and Indians fans will find it enjoyable. 😂"
hw0DyGdUPE8,V W,Kohli is a very vital character Test cricket needs at the moment. Can&#39;t live with him can&#39;t live without him.
hw0DyGdUPE8,FUNNILY STUPID TV,Once a King<br>Always the King<br>King Virat Kohli ❤️
hw0DyGdUPE8,Salman Shaikh,"No, cricket doesn&#39;t need characters like kohli. Cricket is considered a gentleman&#39;s game, and his on field behaviour is just pathetic. He is arrogant and foul mouthed. And I feel very sad when young talents of India follow him. Its side effects were visible in India U19 teams behaviour in that world cup final against bangladesh."
hw0DyGdUPE8,Sultan Niazi,Cricket is a small game only played by a few nations. Ex Colonial nations. It’s a pity as it should be like football. But it never gained popularity so characters like Miandad and Kohli etc will remain mostly unknown to the broader people.
hw0DyGdUPE8,Md kaderuzzaman Soikot,"Cricket is a good and sober game, it actually does not need the character like kohli. You may show your excitement in a jolly way not like a stupid way which make you hatred."
hw0DyGdUPE8,adnan victor,cricket doesn&#39;t need like this kind of character where u abuse someone but foreigner thinks it is aggressive behavior

hw0DyGdUPE8,pratik kumar,King of virat 🇮🇳😎
hw0DyGdUPE8,Tatha 7,without someone like kohli test is boring af...we need energetic and active players for test cricket to survive...otherwise it will shrink...
hw0DyGdUPE8,steve brindle,Vaughan tells it like it is. Kholi is a great batsman and captain and India were not only the best team in this series I agree that at the moment India have the best test team in the world
hw0DyGdUPE8,Sidharth_428,Yes we need little bit emotions but virat&#39;s expressions are more than film actors.
hw0DyGdUPE8,Vicky,Barmy Army taunted virat in fiist innings with trumpet 🎺  song ....hence he replied back
hw0DyGdUPE8,Fine MD,Sucking up to Virat Kohli has done wonders for Fox Cricket and ECB.
hw0DyGdUPE8,black cat,"if Indian loose match then people who are praising virat now, will go bonker on him"

hw0DyGdUPE8,amit sharma,"There is shortage of jokers , so we need character like kohli in the field"
hw0DyGdUPE8,Crazy boy 😀😀,Cricket doesn&#39;t need that type of fucking behaviour anymore....If anyone show his quality then he should be definitely show that in play ground...... Really that type of behaviour doesn&#39;t necessary...

aBLYmkAvy7w,Our Earth is Best!!,Bowlers shouldn&#39;t be the Captain! Remove that thought
aBLYmkAvy7w,Lila Paudel,David warner
aBLYmkAvy7w,Shree Ray,Wow. Here after 2 months to this video. Paine resigned and Cummings became the test captain. 😎😎
aBLYmkAvy7w,Cricfanatic,Epic foreshadowing.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Sharul Technology,Back to captaincy Australia cricket team s smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Sanatani Hindutva,Smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Sheeja NV,I don&#39;t think australia would make Smith their captain because of that old issue
aBLYmkAvy7w,Md Misbah Ul Hoque,I don&#39;t think so that there should be any dout when smith is there in the team
aBLYmkAvy7w,Kcdz225,"We wanna SteveSmith49 back as Australia captain in most tuff format of the game,coz Smith has lots experience in test  captaincy of Australia!!!!! We want Smith as Australia test captain  !!!  Give that test legend a comeback captaincy role,he will prove that it won&#39;t waste!!!!   He desperately wanted his captain role which he paused on 2018 Capetown test !!!!"
aBLYmkAvy7w,Ankit Kumar,Jimmy Anderson is very average baller I&#39;f it is not for swinging condition.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Priyanshu,Steve Smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Vidit Panwar,"Even Imran Khan was a captain that too world cup winning , even though I just never like him still, Tim paine is good but after him Pat Cummins is the best"
aBLYmkAvy7w,anexiel🌀,"I may go for Steve Smith as he has been considered and still is, as one of the greatest batsmen of all time."
aBLYmkAvy7w,Dasharath Mukesh bhai,David Warner should me next Captain
aBLYmkAvy7w,Bajrang Rawani,Steve Smith captain
aBLYmkAvy7w,TASSIEKING,Smith Smith Smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,SAMPA CHAKRABORTY,No way it should not be Cummins Smith should be named captain again ❤️
aBLYmkAvy7w,Cricket England,After what Smith did with the sandpaper issues how the hell can he ever be captain ever again…
aBLYmkAvy7w,Ankur Bedi,Smith is a Cheat..!! Can’t be made the skipper again..!!
aBLYmkAvy7w,J.P. SHARMA,Steve Smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Gavin22,Head is Aussies captain in 5-7 years
aBLYmkAvy7w,Yash Raj,Pat Cummins
aBLYmkAvy7w,Arup Deb,First choice should be Smith then Cummins 🤗
aBLYmkAvy7w,Shuvodeep Ash,"Darren Gough is completely clueless of what he&#39;s talking about... Bubble life is tough but India didn&#39;t pull out of the 5th test because of bubble fatigue... They agreed to play knowing what bubble life is in covid era....<br><br>The reason they pulled out because in the 4th test already the entire senior support staff and the physio tested positive... They still played knowing their assistants are there and lot of senior players are there so they could do without constant inputs from coaches.... But when the assistant physio and massage therapist also tested positive then they had no other options... Both of them were in close contact with all the players...<br><br>If the 5th test match had gone ahead and there was an Indian player who got injured or the fast bowlers needing a recovery massage after a long days work who would have attended them... The England physio?<br><br><br>Secondly there was no strict bubble hence players could just go home and come back again and be with the team... So India didn&#39;t break any protocol by attending the book launch... offcourse you can argue that going to public gathering is not too wise in these times despite there being no strict restriction for the same, but one is always wiser when you have the benefit of hindsight....<br><br><br>Looks like Darren Gough was living in his own beautiful bubble where facts were not allowed to enter hence he thinks Indian players wanted to reach the UAE early for IPL and gave the bio bubble fatigue the reason for it"
aBLYmkAvy7w,Stefan the Sailor,Anderson is the greatest fast bowler of all time- unless you&#39;re counting something other than test wickets taken.
aBLYmkAvy7w,vipul rawat,smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Suman Ram,Steve Smith should be the captain of australia
aBLYmkAvy7w,Priyankan Datta,"just the audacity to call anderson the best fast bowler while the goat is right there. 124 matches 563 wickets at 21 avg. Jimmy is great, no doubt but for me mcgrath and akram are top 2. then steyn and marshall followed by hadlee, holding, ambrose, lilee, waqar, donald, anderson, walsh."
aBLYmkAvy7w,TheRealKeefy,Neither!! Paine will be fit unfortunately
aBLYmkAvy7w,Sanjeevi Ram,"Gough hit the bullseye 🎯 by stating the Indians wanted to prioritise IPL over the Manchester test. Shame on Virat Kohli, Ravi Shastri and BCCI who combined together to stage this drama leaving the fans and English officials high and dry."
aBLYmkAvy7w,George Belly,It&#39;s no doubt ...... One and only Smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Jim Halpert,"There was no &quot;bubble&quot; you bumbling idiot. Even the English players were doing all those things. The hotel had all kinds of guests using the same resources as the players. English people think only their concerns are valid, everyone else&#39;s can go for a toss. What a bunch of selfish a**holes! When their players do it, it&#39;s genuine, when others do it and mind you, India&#39;s concerns were not imaginary, they were basically out of support staff because all of them were isolated and they worried if it will spread further as they step onto the field."
aBLYmkAvy7w,shubhromu,Frontline bowlers nowadays can&#39;t be captain cz they need to be rested off and on and have far more injuries than batsman.
aBLYmkAvy7w,David Hood,If it’s just going to be a test or two they’ll go with Cummins no doubt
aBLYmkAvy7w,gonnaw1n,Laughable saying Smith should be captain again after the cheating scandal...That is basically saying the toughest job as an Aussie cricketer isn&#39;t a standard everyone needs to get to....you can do what you want and occasionally get a smack on the back of the hand but we will turn a blind eye just because you&#39;re a number 1 player....Yeah that teaches great ethics to your younger generation.....LAUGHABLE.
aBLYmkAvy7w,kuldeep dhakad,Smith should be caiptaning
aBLYmkAvy7w,Md Alfayed Ali,"If the last test was played, then the series would surely have been 3-1 in favour of India ( vs England) and so one popular saying &quot; GRAPES ARE SOUR &quot;."
aBLYmkAvy7w,RP69,"Jimmy isn&#39;t the best bowler,M Asif is👍"
aBLYmkAvy7w,RP69,"Paine is the worst Aussie captain till date.Never won any series.Forget about captaincy,he shouldn&#39;t be in playing 11."
aBLYmkAvy7w,AKshun Singh,"A cheat shouldn’t be named a captain. I know it was a mistake and he realised blah blah but for the sake of acknowledging the fact that what he did was just unacceptable, cricket australia should never make him the captain."
aBLYmkAvy7w,RJ Sayz,I think mc grath is the greatest fast bowler as he played in Australia and we all know those days the pitches were quite flat all the time as Aussies had such a great bowling line up they didn&#39;t need any help from the clouds or the pitch. But Anderson in England and outside England not so great is he but McGrath is fantastic everywhere.
aBLYmkAvy7w,71espn,It wasn&#39;t about the bubble. Players were already infected. They could have been a risk to the crowds coming in. What would you say then?
aBLYmkAvy7w,Stefan the Sailor,"Cummins is a suspected cheat, Smith is a confirmed cheat.  If they’re your two options to lead your national side, I guess you give Cummins the benefit of the doubt."
aBLYmkAvy7w,AHSAN HABIB,Steve Smith should be the captain
aBLYmkAvy7w,Tony Blake,🔥
aBLYmkAvy7w,The republican,Steve smith should lead the side @steve
aBLYmkAvy7w,Kishan,"Ideally Smith should be the captain. He has learnt his lesson the hard way. Everyone has moved on. Only thing going is will he be given same liberty as before? And, will he be out to scrutiny more often? But if he himself wants it these questions answer themselves. 👍👍"
aBLYmkAvy7w,Bibhu Prasad Sagariya,Captain Smith. Vice captain patty. And remove tim Paine
aBLYmkAvy7w,yash vaibhav,STFU Mc GRATH  IS GREATER FAST BOLWER
aBLYmkAvy7w,Mr.7,"Smith, not."
aBLYmkAvy7w,Ritvik Sharma,Steve Smith should be captain .
aBLYmkAvy7w,Venu Gopal,Just make smithy as captain and Australia will be good ones again and the matches will be more interesting.and not to blame Paine this should happen after Paine captaincy
aBLYmkAvy7w,faisal yousuf,India vs Australia series were fix other wise it was not possible for india to chase 300 plus on final day in gabba
aBLYmkAvy7w,Antoni Smith,"I am a guy who has been a constant apologist in comments before when it comes to Jimmy, defending him to the hilt against sometimes furious opposition.  Even I however could not bring myself to keep a straight face when the presenter said he was the greatest ever.  Bloody skilful, incredible athlete, and a guy who has helped carry a team for nigh on a decade, but not the greatest ever, no way Jose.  Grumpiest though!!!!"
aBLYmkAvy7w,Tuine Ferero,Adelaide and Sydney they can touch 400<br>But in Melbourne Perth and Brisbane I doubt
aBLYmkAvy7w,Radha Raman Mishra,English are not good team to play against<br>Their rules definition different for different team<br>Your physio tested positive for covid and you should still play cricket certainly money over life<br>Bcoz of 100 India waited for a month to play test but no you should blame IPL
aBLYmkAvy7w,Saptarshi Talukdar,Steve Smith shouldn&#39;t be the captain anymore
aBLYmkAvy7w,Suraj Anand,"Please Make Smith as Captain, if you want to win 🙂.... Let TIm Paine Remove"
aBLYmkAvy7w,Jack Black,Yeah...what did England do SA? Case of sour grapes??
aBLYmkAvy7w,Debojyoti Naskar,"Mr Darren Gough, what bubble are you talking about? There is no hardcore bubble in england at the moment. So, there was no breach of bubble from the Indian cricketers. Moreover this entire narrative of mental fatigue/concern of Indian team was put forward by the ECB. Reality is that a match was abandoned due to Covid influence. England players had done the same thing when they pulled out midway during the South-Africa series. Also kindly refrain from blaming IPL since the 1 week gap between the Lords &amp; Headingley test was due to the 100 league."
aBLYmkAvy7w,amit pillai,Mr Gough....does ECB not priotise Hundred over any other cricket this season.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Venkata anil Prasad,Cummins
aBLYmkAvy7w,JMBeer434,Smith
aBLYmkAvy7w,Royal Boy,Anyone is better than stupid Paine
aBLYmkAvy7w,Vamsi Ampolu,Bring in Pat Cummins...
aBLYmkAvy7w,Mr Straya,is mcgrath on fox not seven? or just a guest appearance?
aBLYmkAvy7w,H i R o xtx,This man is talking all bullshit <br>Read some articles.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Aditya Dande,"pat cummings be like, why i am a vice captain if i am never gonna be captain ??"
aBLYmkAvy7w,raviranjan kumar,Anderson is not the greatest the man sitting next to you is the greatest i have ever seen.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Shakil Ahmed Shuvro,Smith Captain Cummins vice captain
aBLYmkAvy7w,Chall hatt!,Yo! It should be Marnie! Smith has a ban
aBLYmkAvy7w,Bhavik Shankar,McGrath is the greatest.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Jay lodaya,Mr Gough your team pulled out of South Africa tour when there was positive case in hotel staff and now giving us explanation that India left test match for IPL??? <br><br>If ECB were so concerned about  the tour then should have played all test matches behind closed doors and strict bio secure buble should have been implemented.<br><br>Both the teams were equally responsible so stop pinpointing it.
aBLYmkAvy7w,Suraj Roy,You can make Smithy captain again if he promises not to rubb that ball again
aBLYmkAvy7w,Saurav Gada,Why Cummins was made the vice captain if he isn&#39;t the automatic choice of the captain
aBLYmkAvy7w,Ajay Kumar Gupta,Why not marnus he would be good captain
aBLYmkAvy7w,Vijay Thayore,Smith 100%
aBLYmkAvy7w,Atharva Deshmukh,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBLYmkAvy7w&amp;t=2m45s"">2:45</a> this man is right . BCCI can do anything for IPL like cancelling a test match"

Pak were missing big names and consistent performers for last 2 editions that&#39;s why they didn&#39;t make it to semis in 2014 and 2016, but otherwise we have been  a top class and most consistent team, played final in2007, won in 09, sf in10,12 and 21."

We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God&#39;s child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).

HZEysoHgeD4,Emad Ahmed,It&#39;s amazing how wrong you can sometimes be despite being an experienced analyst of the game. Mark Waugh said Pakistan wasn&#39;t even in his frame for the semis. Obviously he had some reasoning behind it so I&#39;m not gonna give him crap for it. But cut to two weeks later and Pakistan became the first team to qualify for the semis and the only undefeated team in the group stages.

HZEysoHgeD4,anilramannair,"BLM is not good for any country as it’s funded by super rich lobbyists who have their own interests that we may not be able to understand now.<br><br>Indian team is acting to the tunes of Indian government to loose the game asap and get out of UAE, so that lesser people view the BLM craziness.<br><br>I am pretty sure that Indian government doesn’t want BLM to establish in India. BCCI should have received strict instructions to loose the match in the preliminaries.<br><br>As soon as Indian team is out of the tournament, the viewership will drop in India and BLM will not get free publicity.<br><br>And I am pretty sure that the Championship is reserved for South Africa. They have the first black captain, and a very diverse team and we already saw a former captain showing his disappointment about what is going on. A black captain winning SA ‘s first ever World Cup. Well that will be something to sell all over the world.<br><br>It’s a match fixed by worlds biggest criminals. It’s better to get out of UAE as soon as possible. <br><br>These lobbyists criminals control the pharmaceutical supply chains, have complete control of social media and the can bring governments down. <br><br>Governments are scared and they will do exactly what the new generation East India Company is asking them.<br><br>India will not get the approval for COVAXIN, if they don’t take a knee is support of the BLM.<br><br>I have my sympathies for the players from all the teams playing this tournament. They don’t stand a chance. <br><br>Let’s wait for SA to take the cup home."

HZEysoHgeD4,Zain Waseem,Mark wagh is zero cricketing knowledge
HZEysoHgeD4,Zawar Shah,Anybody who doesn&#39;t give pakistan a chance to win any game or tournament in world cricket . Is crazy on any given day pakistani team can win any match. In the past many pakistani players were bought by the Indian gambling mafia. So they threw away matches on the command of the Indian gambling mafia. Who paid them.. The pakistani team now is going to win the World Cup t20. They didn&#39;t take the money on offer by the Indian bookmakers mafia.. Watch how Pakistan perform. And win every match they will be unbeaten in this tournament.

HZEysoHgeD4,Beam me up,Australia cheat at cricket !! No native Australian has ever played for Australia. Indian caste system is worse that apartheid ever was. Pakistan and terrorists  yet …. ??  If you could not play against apartheid South Africa: how can you play against these three ??

HZEysoHgeD4,Jason Kyle,"O Keefe was more reasonable, he was spot on for Shaheen Afridi, Fakhar, and Rizwan. It seems like he knew what these players were going to do. Excellent analysis by O&#39;Keef. I do not follow IPL so I am not sure his stake in IPL, I figure none but It would be interesting to know."
HZEysoHgeD4,Jason Kyle,"Most Australians make good money playing, coaching, and in a commentary in India so It&#39;s understandable to not hurt the feelings of Indian fans and some ass-kissing."
HZEysoHgeD4,Sachin Kumar,I want india to win this but pakistan certainly playing like they deserve it.

s0jAynhc0JY,arbosssm4,blm is a hate group just like the kkk
s0jAynhc0JY,Shaq Fraser,would not trust de cock as far as i could throw him! not taking the knee means you&#39;re standing with racism.... dont let that bad apple back in the camp!
s0jAynhc0JY,A J,De Kock ...what a shame
s0jAynhc0JY,Assie Van der Westhuizen,"Bending the knee for BLM has nothing to do with racism: the founding members are Luceferian witches who are hell bent on replacing orderly societies with Marxist, atheistic ideologies and lifestyles."
s0jAynhc0JY,Comic Tube,Taking a knee shows the person is not racist🤔<br>Totally disagree
s0jAynhc0JY,Lord Master,Wokeness has no place in cricket. This coercion to take the knee is a result of the mob mentality and peer pressure.
s0jAynhc0JY,Count Knersis,"How the media and people with sticks up their arses can make something out of nothing. Blow a whistle to kneel and blow a whistle to get up. This is cricket, not the NBA. America must always spill over into the world."
s0jAynhc0JY,Hussain Sarwar,Quinton de cockless South Africa.
s0jAynhc0JY,Richard Moonstone,"Sorry, I&#39;m black and I am embarrassed by all this taking the knee liberal nonsense. If I was a cricket player, maybe I would have taken the knee a couple of times some time ago, but that&#39;s it. Now it&#39;s just pathetic, especially to force people to do it against their will. It&#39;s just do exhausting and embarrassing and has nothing to do with black people or the black struggle and everything to do with the liberal elite and their own long term agenda."
s0jAynhc0JY,Jacques Mulder,BLM is just another movement to target white people.
s0jAynhc0JY,Johann Schlebusch,Pommy is out of his depth....he should be fired as commentator for being racist...BLM is a pure racist and political issue and CSA should focus on the sport and keep (onesided) politics out of sports.
s0jAynhc0JY,Halbø,Let&#39;s go Quinton!
s0jAynhc0JY,kturst s,"he wa forced to apologize, bs politics.... forced to knee..."
s0jAynhc0JY,Icetee videos,"Quinten De Kock, that was very stupid of you to apologize and goes against your believes"
s0jAynhc0JY,Soumya Ghosh,no need to apologise
s0jAynhc0JY,J L,Keep politics and race out of sport. Just another globalist agenda.
s0jAynhc0JY,TheMets692006,You play with black people bro and you refused to show solidarity against racism and discrimination against black and brown people against a black opponent.   2nd time he did this.  You can regain form but your reputation is tarnished.  If I was his teammate I would deal with him on a cricket level only nothing else...  and there is no overreacting on the public behalf.  Can you imagine someone saying they would never kneel to show solidarity against the holocaust????
s0jAynhc0JY,Gary & Annette Edwards,@ 0.49 .. Shamsi covering all bases including LBGTQXYZ. Well done.
s0jAynhc0JY,FOMO FUD,As a white South African the way my captain spoke at that press conference made me very very proud. He de-esculated a very tricky situation. Come on Proteas!!
s0jAynhc0JY,Raja Zubair.,Agree with Haddin
s0jAynhc0JY,Raja Zubair.,Humans are alike.
s0jAynhc0JY,Paul Shaw,"Quinton, do like all other wise South Africans are doing, pack your bags and leave. When issues like this demand that sport bend to political will then as far as I&#39;m concerned, that particular sport has been compromised."
s0jAynhc0JY,Mark Stuart-Howie,Ironically racial quotas in south african sports is rascist by definition so really hyprcritical to take a knee against rascism!
s0jAynhc0JY,X,"According to me, what he did was wrong and the apology was a fitting one too, but many people in the comment section seem to forget the incident because of the apology, I am not writing this to tell that he is an bad person but he should be atleast given X no. of match ban as a fine will not bother him. I know he has sportsmanship but it doesn&#39;t mean he is right in everything . Even kallis did a similar thing so it isn&#39;t the first time it is happening in south africa"

s0jAynhc0JY,Tertius de Jager,Too much government involved.
s0jAynhc0JY,H S,Well done Quinton de kock for not bending your knees. Proud of you.
s0jAynhc0JY,Pastor Moeti,"He&#39;s (Themba) so calm this storm I believe as Captain that sets the tone for the rest of the Team. <br>He&#39;s been a successful Captain of the Lions  (S.A. Local Franchise) as a racially charged country these tensions are always there they need maturity to deal with, not be swept under the floor it is a bit embarrassing that this is happening in world stage but uncomfortable as the captain is in the press conference but He did well on the day. <br>The lesson is that let&#39;s deal with these racial tensions head on We are such an incredible country walls of prejudice must come down let&#39;s take this Sport to the rural, townships,  and informal settlement especially to schools across the length and breath of our country there&#39;s too much potential. I for one busy with a plan of sports academy<br><br>He might be short LOL but He&#39;s a leader of note and is here on merit, Yes in South Africa We&#39;re blessed with so much more talent and leaders but let&#39;s support this team. <br><br>Now let&#39;s move on and do what We can do best play cricket!<br><br>As for me their confidence is growing in leaps and bounds We might be in for Surprise World Cup performance or even Win it!!!<br>Thabiso Moeti Invest4truth@<a href=""http://gmail.com/"">gmail.com</a>"

s0jAynhc0JY,Nikhil Krishnan,Blm is bullying cricketers too?? <br>Are you kidding me??
s0jAynhc0JY,Gold Leaf,"What’s going on is South Africa now days, it’s the whites who are afraid of their lives because of blacks.   This BLM doesn’t apply everywhere and you have to base it on your personal experience"
s0jAynhc0JY,Duggi on Battlefield,"Every life matters , not only white , black , Asian etc also the other living beings like animals , but can I force people to kneel for animals when they themselves eat them? So it&#39;s just a matter of perception, Quinton did something in reaction to his thoughts, no one should be judged by someone&#39;s resistance to something"

s0jAynhc0JY,Enliven Rex,There is something very wrong when employers force their employees to kneel and no issue can justify that. Not even police oppression or genocide anywhere. Just imagine for a while if the diktat to kneel had come from Taliban against its cricketers. The news slant and outrage would have been deafening. But when liberals force you to kneel or neuter the language then it&#39;s something to be adhered unfailingly. Batsmen and batswomen are now batters. Why? If this is good then remove he and she also and just completely neuter the language!

s0jAynhc0JY,Paul Kruger,I am extremely disappointed in Quinton &amp; have lost all respect for him for suddenly reversing his decision &amp; to make matters worse for apologizing for his original decision! Money must have changed his mind!
s0jAynhc0JY,DevilGamer,"Mandating something like this is just stupid. Let people do their own research, make up their own mind, and if they are alright with the twitter crazies coming after them, then let them skip the kneeling. BLM is a terrible organisation, run by corrupt people who spend multitudes more on themselves than they ever have on improving black lives, and who push for change that will systematically make black lives worse. Thats just factual. Now, if we look at the idea of BLM instead, what exactly has kneeling done? Genuine racists are still going to be racist, that isnt doing anything. Now, if people were donating to funds to go to improving schools in majority black areas, to go to strengthening families to stop the all-too-common theme of a fatherless black household, then they are actually doing something. This is just making the players into puppets, putting on an act to try and please the vocal woke. Honestly a little disappointing that de Kock caved, but with all the pressure that would have been on him its very understandable."

XoAgXMRwamM,Historic depth ☄️💯,Steve Smith 🏆 is Very important player for Aussie !!! 💯 Bcoz he&#39;s Backbone in All 3 Format&#39;s 💨
XoAgXMRwamM,Sujatha Ganapathy,Thanks warnie …the team proved you wrong…your analysis Is not as good your cricketing skills
XoAgXMRwamM,Saif Khan,Warnie has lost his mind if he thinks Steve smith should be dropped. Every team needs a batsman like him who can knock around the ball and rotate strike. But with Smith he can mess up a bowlers head with all his movements across the crease and the freaky shots he plays.
XoAgXMRwamM,Lindsay Kelly,Warnie Barbados is nice this time of year
XoAgXMRwamM,ROCTEX,CUP ON THE HANDS AUSSIE🧡💥💓🔥🤘🔥🔥🔥💥💥
XoAgXMRwamM,movieklump,Smiths involvement in the T20 world cup victory.  Nothing. At least he did get out quickly which gave the team a chance.
XoAgXMRwamM,Manasiz Paul,This aged well🤡
XoAgXMRwamM,Dizzy Davis,Warne vindicated
XoAgXMRwamM,Dave,It must be incredible knowing everything like Shane Warne does
XoAgXMRwamM,WOW_ Tuckbudford,I don&#39;t like steve smith in T20 he&#39;s frustrating as hell to watch.
XoAgXMRwamM,Joseph Xavier,Just give Smithy a chance
XoAgXMRwamM,Azieee1996,shane warne doesn’t make sense often and he does not disappoint
XoAgXMRwamM,Mat Slater F,Steve Smith was really great at Rajasthan and Pune in the early stages of his career! Expected him to evolve into a better player in t20s but that never happened.
XoAgXMRwamM,2partiesnotpreferred,"You pick the best t20 you have. And you need to be flexible. Wade should of come in instead of Maxwell. You have 10 wickets to play with. Was Justin langer asleep? Brad Hodge said it best during his commentary in the wbbl. &quot; you need to use all of your resources&quot; starc needs to be dropped, his spot in the team is to safe so he just trundles in. You only can bowl four overs so rip in brett lee style. He&#39;s bowling like nathan bracken. Trash."
XoAgXMRwamM,Ram,Warne : Beast &amp; Bang
XoAgXMRwamM,Macka,Warner lost the right of holding a position in the team based on previous form as soon as he bought out the sandpaper in Capetown.<br>He should be EARNING his position in the team given the damage he&#39;s previously caused it. Joke
XoAgXMRwamM,cyrilv1703,"I respect Warne for everything he has done in his cricketing career but mate how can you be so wrong about Steve Smith. I mean, there were times when I had doubts about Smith being a one format wonder but then it has been proven time and again that that is not the case. He may not be exceptionally good at White Ball cricket but then he is someone who can be reckoned as a proper White Ball Cricketer as well. Have seen him score fast hundreds, hundreds in the T20 format as well. It&#39;s just that people tinker a lot about his position that sort of puts a bit of pressure on him. Like for example, in the Red Ball game, nobody looks past him. He is who he is but come White Ball, and there are others who are given a Go over Steve Smith. He is a recognized chap in the line - up; dropping him could be disastrous because not only is he a valuable bat but he is an exceptional fielder. You simply can&#39;t let assets like him sit on the bench."
XoAgXMRwamM,UK Affairs,Why India 🇮🇳 vs Afghanistan 🇦🇫 match was a fixed match ? Please comment ?
XoAgXMRwamM,sid syed,Australia made a big mistake when didn&#39;t pick Usman Khawja for the t20 world cup. He is in great form and scored 100 and 71 in PSL recently in Dubai and his track record is been so good in these sorts of pitches. Warner is out of form and Smith is not a T20 batsman you need batsmen who are on form and give you a good start. Nothing against David Warner but if the batsmen is out of form and not scoring then you must bring someone who is in good touch. It&#39;s too late now but I guess Shane Warne is right and they should drop Smith and bring Mitch Marsh or even David Warner and open with Stoinis to give them a chance.
XoAgXMRwamM,Firoz Ahmed Sanullah,"Like Shoab Malik, S Smith can play a role binding the innings So yes"
XoAgXMRwamM,Anurag Borkar,I don&#39;t agree to anything Warne is saying. Steve Smith is an awesome player irrespective of the kind of cricket. His comment on maxwell is completely wrong. If he is your best t20 batsman then power play or not doesn&#39;t matter. The fact is Joss Buttler played a blinder
XoAgXMRwamM,Nothm,Bro this guy thinks Mitchell Marsh is better than Steve Smith 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
XoAgXMRwamM,Anubhav Thapa,Totally agreed Warnie! Love how you’re being frank and honest..
XoAgXMRwamM,Waq786,Beast mode
XoAgXMRwamM,Mohammed Nadim,England got rid of Root in T20 and smith doesn’t bind the innings like babar or kohli..I think warnie  is spot on..it is unbelievable to think the aussies haven’t won a T20 World Cup..and this the 7th world cup.
XoAgXMRwamM,BROTIN BHATTACHARJEE,As an Indian and as a cricket fan<br>I will say one thing<br>Australian public and media is saying Smith is not too good in T20.<br>Ok whatever it is you cannot change him plus he is Australia&#39;s best batsman .<br>And what to do with Warner<br>He hadn&#39;t scored really with due respect.<br>Steve Smith is still much more valuable than David Warner if he is not a proper T20 player.<br>At least one must remember when it&#39;s 10-2 or 15-2 for Aus Steve Smith scores at least 20-25 runs to save his team .
XoAgXMRwamM,Prateek Pusalkar,Nothing wrong
XoAgXMRwamM,Robert Petrie,"With an average not much behind Chris Lynn and a strike rate of over 125, which is also not far behind Chris Lynn, I think Steve Smith can hold his own in T20 and he can clear boundaries quite easily to."

XoAgXMRwamM,Mathachan Ouseph,Stark is burntout.
XoAgXMRwamM,RAJNEESH PATHAK,"We must not forget that Steve Smith saves Australia against South Africa with his manner of batting.... He is a anchor of Australia&#39;s batting line-up<br>Against England, he got out in a strange way unlucky dismissal that was"
XoAgXMRwamM,Ranganath A,No. Smith should be there to play test match in T20. Wil miss him otherwise
XoAgXMRwamM,Abhinav Chandra,Stoinis bats like Glenn Mcgrath 😂😂😂
XoAgXMRwamM,VƗҜΔŞ,&quot;Bowlers win you the matches.&quot;
XoAgXMRwamM,Everest Slaying The Game,He talking much of beast mode..... Idk if he is thinking aus to make ind in this Wc..
XoAgXMRwamM,Everest Slaying The Game,U ever reckoned the situation we been through in tour against bangladesh... Bullshit from warne on smith..He can be the best anchor for aus team.. he can be 100% dependable on that role
XoAgXMRwamM,Shreyas G,Same goes with virat kohli. Have a look at his S/R in the last two ipl. He needs stadiums like Chinnaswamy to score quick runs.
XoAgXMRwamM,abhishek chawhan,"No  doubt shane Warne is a big name, but as a analyst he has very poor knowledge. When you are supporting bits and pieces cricketer with master class that show how good you are. Stonis, marsh and Maxwell are one dimensional player, they are ok ok against spin, all the team who won the tournament have a solid number 3. Even he said the example of pak then both rizwan and babar play anchor inning so don&#39;t be double standard."
XoAgXMRwamM,DIPANKAR SHARMA,As a Australian supporter best xi is <br><br>David <br>Wade (wk)<br>Marsh <br>Finch <br>Maxwell<br>Stoinis <br>Agar <br>Pat <br>Starc<br>Hazelwood <br>Richardson<br><br>Finch should bat lower Orders
XoAgXMRwamM,Ravi Shankar,Shane &#39;beast mode&#39; Warne
XoAgXMRwamM,Mike Short,Buttler was surely in beastest mode.
XoAgXMRwamM,north melbourne,i would play ben dunk at 3 for australia maybe
XoAgXMRwamM,north melbourne,my team for australia batting is finch warner wade labuschange smith careyl stoinis marsh agar starc cummins
XoAgXMRwamM,Ismaila Hamidoloko,I like it when the the English team get one ☝️ over the Aussie they turn to 😿 crybabies and giving excuses.
XoAgXMRwamM,C3,"He&#39;s got strong opinions but I think he&#39;s not wrong here. Australia&#39;s tactics are all over the place. They don&#39;t know what style they want to play, it changes every game. If Mitch Marsh was succeeding at 3 then keep him there. If Hazlewood is our best pace bowler, then he should get the first over. It&#39;s so simple but they&#39;re trying to overcomplicate things."
XoAgXMRwamM,sanjaya ranasinghe,How about Chris Lynn or Darcy Short
XoAgXMRwamM,Kabir Gautam,Finchy needs to do well he absolutely just does this weird dance against early swingers and warner (well how are you😂😂)
XoAgXMRwamM,Ravi paik,Smith and Williamson are very important in t20i team....because they know how to run the game...if there is no boundaries or in slow pitch...
XoAgXMRwamM,tyson nobson,Become the Australian coach then Warnie
XoAgXMRwamM,Atharva Paranjape,Report says shane warne names his kid beast 😂😂😂
XoAgXMRwamM,unbiased fan,His analysis are so poor. Both of the top 2 guys in ICC t20 ranking are not big hitters and neither is Kohli or Kane Williamson. It&#39;s the strategy that gets you into a good position. Mitch marsh has no clue on these wickets while playing against international sides. (IPL doesn&#39;t count because is not good enough).
XoAgXMRwamM,Safwaan Habeeb,"SAC JUSTIN LANGER… Aussies have lost their DNA of aggression in his tenure tbh.. Cannot be debating over the same fact that Australia retained the Ashes in England under his coaching.. If so, there was Waugh in the team for that specific Ashes tour to England.. If Langer continues, Aussies might repeat what happened in the last summer down under in this Ashes too..<br>Get in Waugh or Ponting or Warne.. This Mighty team needs a change in their attitude.."
XoAgXMRwamM,Fearless mind,I ma from Indian but I would love to see Alex Hales and Worrall in the Australian team
XoAgXMRwamM,The614GHOST,"IPL destroyed both aus and Ind intl t20 teams, players and board kept on giving priority to IPL then int&#39;l cricket"
XoAgXMRwamM,Tamil Kanal,"Is Finch, Warner,starc,Cummins,Wade,stoinis good enough to be in t20 team?"
XoAgXMRwamM,rohit,"What an insightful tactics by warne. Absolute legend of the game.<br>India too needs to change its t20 and odi setup, time to learn from england."
XoAgXMRwamM,ST,Wow. Marsh didn&#39;t give a single performance in the two warm-up matches and threw away his wicket against SA in an easy chase. It was Smith who prevented a collapse. A single bad shot and Warne wants him out of the side. Remove Warner Cummins and Starc too then.
XoAgXMRwamM,With Amber Arya,Smith should open.
XoAgXMRwamM,Milind Gharpure,"Smith is not good  enough  for t 20, look at his recent  IPL performance"
XoAgXMRwamM,DreamBig,Going by what Shane Warne is saying...I agree....similarly Indian team should play the qualifiers....they donot deserve to play World t20...arsehole and disgraceful team to be honest
XoAgXMRwamM,Kryptonite_smassao,That has always been Pakistan&#39;s philosophy for last 50 years: bowlers win you matches and tournaments. England started following it by bringing in Archer in last WC and now Warne is arguing the same.
XoAgXMRwamM,southside,M watching cricket for more than 20 years and I am crazy of this game. But in my opinion Smith is not a t20 player honestly.
XoAgXMRwamM,Lindsay Kelly,Please Warnie leave our star alone he will get runs we will rely on him
XoAgXMRwamM,rohan prakash,"I wish we could have Warne always selecting the team who plays against us. He is a complete moron. Has a man crush on Pandya and his team selection is like him, brash, crude and short sighted. Stoinis, Jesus he shouldn&#39;t even be playing gully cricket."
XoAgXMRwamM,LINEY the G,Open Smith with Finchy and drop Warner
XoAgXMRwamM,Give Away,Smith is good enough player. I do not think any team has done well batting first. But Marsh also has to be in team as he can smack the ball
XoAgXMRwamM,psl live,"IPL,IPL......why don&#39;t anyone realize that world cup is far different than IPL.....there you play for country against opponents best team .....much more pressure than playing for franchise"

Harry Solomon, a very kind person, owner of Kingsgrove sports help me realise my dream of meeting my imaginary friend, my confidant (imaginary) Mark Waugh since 1994 ❤. Luv u Mark 😊💖"
-6-rikAz2Rw,sunnyb831,Almost a legend
-6-rikAz2Rw,Theena,"Best slip fielders to ever play the game? Sorry but that&#39;s understating Junior&#39;s real value as a fielder. No one, and  I mean no one, made catching the cricket ball look as normal as M Waugh did. Does anyone remember Inzi&#39;s cut shot off Shane Warne that Junior caught with finger tips and nonchalantly threw back in &#39;celebration&#39;? Dude is ridiculous."

Yv1XCipXhwA,Ralph Reilly,Little Ern. Awww. I loved that comic duo.
Yv1XCipXhwA,Taste With Jase,As an pommie English kid growing up in the 80&#39;s Merv was an absolute icon. The John Daly of cricket! Love him.
Yv1XCipXhwA,lnnotes,Bream buried in big merv&#39;s guts for a magnificent caught and bowled
Yv1XCipXhwA,Dupree Mottley,Merv the swerve..remember his battles with my West Indies team. He saved his best abuse for Gordon Greenidge but it was fun to watch. Good old days
Yv1XCipXhwA,Vijay Iyer,I remember merv hughes being a world class fast bowler. he would have walked into the starting elevens of most test teams in the world. i like to ask any australian viewers of this clip whether he was part of the team that won the world cup in 1987 ?
Yv1XCipXhwA,A Bobble,Look up “colourful character” in the dictionary and there is a picture of big Merv. Loved watching him compete against us in the Ashes. I’d LOVE to visit Australia and what a dream it would be to sit on a riverbank with Merv with a few tinnies listening to his amazing stories. Legend.

KlMWBCAT-Zc,Rishabh Gupta,Brad haddin to me was one of the best wicket keeper batsman that I have come across. For him it was much more difficult since he needed to come out of Gilchrist&#39;s shadow. But he did well both with the bat and the gloves.
KlMWBCAT-Zc,hyena131,"Very possibly the two dullest, monotone cricket commentators today, though they have very tough competition with little &#39;I hold a grudge&#39; mike haysman and Vernon &#39;yuh&#39; Philander.  But it appears the latter two have not had their commentary contracts renewed...fingers crossed."
KlMWBCAT-Zc,Nikhil Parpudi,Quality time with a laudu
KlMWBCAT-Zc,MOHAN N,"Brad Haddin was a good player, he is a successor of Adam Gilchrist."

OLkzBSPvkwQ,Boom Krish,"Mike Vaughan and Geoff Boycott are the two yorkies ,who always keep criticising Indian cricket.<br>But they are constructive as well."

OLkzBSPvkwQ,Nick Parmar,So... Fox have adopted the racist piglet?
OLkzBSPvkwQ,K W,"New found respect for Michael Vaughan for sitting next to Shane f*cking Warne for a whole test series and not putting one on his chin. All class Mr Vaughan, all class."
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Jason Cole,Why is it in cricket the more you where average has a player...u are automatically given premise 2 become chairman of the board..an greats of the game are snubbed. It ain&#39;t wot u knw ay....
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Shubham Prabhakar,Vaughan : &#39;He was batting in the 90&#39;s&#39; <br>Anchor : &#39;Like your bowling average&#39; 😂
OLkzBSPvkwQ,haider hasan,Not sure if australian viewers feel differently but kerry o feefe ron howard and james brayshaw are the worst additions to commentary. Add mark nicholas to that list
OLkzBSPvkwQ,RAHUL GUPTA,Can never forget that dismissal of tendulkar
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Andrew Watts,You mean the English can play cricket???
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Shivian124,Should Root stand down? Well what has England gotten wrong this tour? Their fielding has been extremely costly. Their batting toughness has not been good enough when the series was still live. Are those things you can point at Joe? I really don&#39;t think so.
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Shivian124,"Yep Vaughan often nails it. Has great perspective, balance and the right tact on honestly too."
OLkzBSPvkwQ,MallardMan1980,"I&#39;ve only been to a couple of Test matches, but seeing Vaughan bowling out Tendulkar was an &quot;I was there&quot; moment for sure!"

OLkzBSPvkwQ,The Pimpernel,The players are paid more than the coach. People pay to watch players play. Having a coach on a cricket team is a fairly recent thing in cricket 25 yrs or so. But they play more games.
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Vinny On Wheels,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLkzBSPvkwQ&amp;t=9m54s"">9:54</a> this was hilarious AF🤣"
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Toonarmy,what so we have a mediocre ashes series after all the team have achieved recently and you want root to step down. LOL
OLkzBSPvkwQ,BA A,It was a no ball on which you got Sachin out
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Mareena Paul,It was a no ball. Sachin Tendulkar was technically ‘not out’. Just run through the replay and you’ll know.
OLkzBSPvkwQ,doclovescricicket#,Skull
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Richard O'Shea,who is that wheezy bald guy
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Kevin Christopher,Glad to see Vaughn been given a platform. Good on Aussie media. They dodnt believe in cancel culture. Bloody Rafeeq. Took down a whole historic club and cost so many jobs just because his feelings were hurt and not because he was a rubbish cricketer and didn&#39;t deserve a place in the team.
OLkzBSPvkwQ,Kevin Christopher,Please upload more like this on YouTube. Quite enjoyable.  <br>Better than watching an Indian Panel discuss how great Kohli is or how great the Indian team is to please sponsors.

mjcFG-tS3Ho,Alan Clow,"So many world class sportmen can&#39;t explain what, how, when and why they do what they do; but, a few really great ones have the ability to analyse and simplify for others; Warne had that. What a tragic loss to world cricket. <br><br>Us South Africans started off hating Warne; all it took was one test to realise how great a player, sportsman and entertainer he was."

(Understatement of the century I know) but the ashes that year really drew me into the sport."
mjcFG-tS3Ho,lurker 1974,"God bless you, Shane Warne.  I could listen to the sorcery of spin for hours when he talks about grip and angles.  Rest In Peace."
mjcFG-tS3Ho,Faze_washington6,Just a tragedy. Stolen
mjcFG-tS3Ho,Jeff Stryker,"I still can’t believe he’s gone😭Rip Warnie,condolences to his family."

As they say, time will heal everything but this has not sunk in yet, RIP champ! Love you so much."
mjcFG-tS3Ho,Joel D.,Masterclass from the man. Cheers warnie
mjcFG-tS3Ho,Gil Balfas,Grip it &amp; RIP it in heaven Shane. thankyou for lighting up this world.

mjcFG-tS3Ho,Nath Perera,Genuine honesty in the voice and words when explaining the art that he had mastered. What a loss.

dDD371tK7Ns,Ahmad tech,soo sad for shane warne he is no more
dDD371tK7Ns,Akash Srivastav,"this is not a perception, its  a deduction from previous events. Back in 2009 ,12 gun men a surrounding sri lankan team bus ,firing them with bullets and grenades is sight that has never happened in cricket. players got shot and injured heavily. suicide bomb blast near team hotel where nz players were staying in karachi in 2002.lot of people got killed that day including some frenchman. pakistan media  speaks about it as if it was <a href=""http://nothing.it/"">nothing.it</a> may be normal in pakistan because they have a habit of hiding terrorist in their backyard. Osama bin laden was found hiding in pakistan before he was caught .that&#39;s not a coincidence. I  dont have any grudge against normal people in pakistan because they are like all of us but the people at the top who are calling the shots are letting pakistan down.i myself have pakistani friends living in middle east who definitely agrees to it.  abu salem is another one who has been living in karachi as found by intelligence <a href=""http://agencies.as/"">agencies.as</a> shoaib akhtar said pakistan is a safe haven ,even for terrorists. if you are player playing for some nation you will definitely be hesitant to tour pakistan because at the end of the day life is more  important."
dDD371tK7Ns,Hasan Tariq,boys the tour is on because there are security concerns in the country. Does not make any sense by them landing in pakistan. a big news in england.
dDD371tK7Ns,Carry Mintos,Aus lives matter 🤣
dDD371tK7Ns,X univrse,Thanks fox cricket and thier journalist for supporting pak point of view against big three.yeah pakistan is a safest country of the world
dDD371tK7Ns,Ali Hussain,"We&#39;re excited to host the Ozzies, they are cricketing folklore and have produced some of the most outstanding players the world has ever seen. Looking forward to having you and  looking forward to some exciting cricket."
dDD371tK7Ns,BUBBLES,Dear Aussies! <br>Just come play against Pakistan and it will change your opinion about Pakistan! This is not the old Pakistan team anymore!

dDD371tK7Ns,Haider Abbas,Welcome to Pakistan 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
dDD371tK7Ns,Hall D,"after the way the players treated Justin Langer, this aussie will be wearing a pakistan jersey throughout the tour"
dDD371tK7Ns,The Dude Farooqi,How is Pakistan a &quot;Lesser cricketing Nation&quot;? The amount of ignorance behind that tagline is not only disrespectful it&#39;s downright hypocrisy. No Aussie cares about cricket outside their backyard. Australia have won 6 World Cups and I doubt a random passer-by on an Australian team will know the Captain of the current squad.<br><br>This racist and colonial mentality needs to be addressed.
dDD371tK7Ns,discover beauty,Well come team Australia 🇵🇰🇨🇰
dDD371tK7Ns,Vikas Sharma,"India just need 1 action and aus can cancel compleate tour , so faltu mai pange mat lena waise baat to ho hi gyi hai wait karo , players to nahi aarhe ☺  ya to z team bhejenge ya fir nahi"

dDD371tK7Ns,MoreCharacters WithAMix,Australia are brave and perhaps foolish to visit Pakistan. The TTP is in full force in Pakistan and would definitely look to attack Australian team. May god save them.

6GUKBe6Y0dw,TMA,You have forgot to mention Sohail tanvir
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Hassaan Qureshi,I don&#39;t think Ausliatian criketers have even a slightest of idea of how much fandom they have in Pakistan.<br>I hope they allow full crowds in the stadium hoping covid situation is in control. They&#39;ll get to see the Pakistani elctrifying crowds.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,The Curious Servant,Take the racist cult out from here
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Shah Zain Khan,Love Uzzie From Pakistan 🇵🇰.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Gullu Butt,the new ara start when Aus comes 2 Pak....
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Graeme Hampton,In retrospect it&#39;s unfortunate that Uzzie wasn&#39;t made captain after South Africa rubbish. Imagine him leading a tour to subcontinent. That would  have been history making and would have built some bridges.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Faheem Rana,This is so beautiful to listen Usman talking so logically about a deprived country and give something back to game of cricket !
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Adeel Chaudhry,They forgot about Pakistani Sohail Tanveers action from almost 20 years ago to this day ! <br>The modern progenitor of awkward bowling  actions  !!!!!
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Manan Sheikh,Pakistan deserve more than this
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Mr Excel,"Khawaja should also talk about the reason international team don&#39;t visit Pakistan. TERRORIST BORN, LIVE AND WORSHIP IN Pakistan. Hypocrite"

6GUKBe6Y0dw,Uncle James ,"I am waiting for for the like of Australia, England and India to visit Pakistan. Usman Khawaja rightly said this will inspire the next generation and it is good for the cricket. Pakistan is cricket loving nation and it will welcome all the teams visiting Pakistan."
6GUKBe6Y0dw,tufailkhan tufail,Pakistan is World classical team. Australian Cricket must go to Pakistan.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Imtiaz Alam Hanfi,We all Pakistani are waiting to Australia visit of Pakistan

6GUKBe6Y0dw,banuri,Tour Pakistan and turn off your emails 🙂
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Advocate Santhosh Reddy,Who is paying these rascals as they are vouching for playing Pak in Pak????<br><br>10 years back entire SL team got killed. At least 4 Security agencies have warned NZ team not to go to Pak.<br><br>Virtually every incidence happens has it roots to Pak.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,It’s All About U,Welcome Australian Cricket Team 🇦🇺 🇵🇰 ❤️
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Muhammad Abbas,"thanks alot usman khawaja,,, but after what kiwis did i do not trust australia, england teams any more"
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Edeel wcw,Australia will loose the series in Pak ..b/c Pak is very very tough team even in neutral ground just imagine wot will they can do in home ground they can give chance to a new bowler like Dhani which is hardest to play .............
6GUKBe6Y0dw,SHAWAL NAWAZ,"can not wait for australlia to visit Pakistan, and watch smith leave the  ball  the way he does."

6GUKBe6Y0dw,Celebrity Samachar,"Why don&#39;t Usman Khwaja ask Pakistan Government and Pakistan Army to first stop supporting terrorist if he loves so much of Pakistan Cricket......Usman Khwaja is Pakistani ISI agent living in Australia....Why is Pakistan is sitting in China&#39;s Lap.....Aussies know China is creator of covid, I m sure Aussies will postpone the tour of Pak"

6GUKBe6Y0dw,shahzeb360,Desperately waiting for 🇦🇺 to visit 🇵🇰 ♥
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Bharath R,"I am an Indian and I hope this happens. Cricket is missing far too much without Pakistani bowling.<br>But most importantly, I hope India tours Pakistan and vice versa!! I had been to the India-Pakistan match in Bangalore in 1996 and nothing comes close to that atmosphere. Absolutely Nothing"
6GUKBe6Y0dw,H. O. G.,Unfortunately reasons are beyond cricket.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,The Lionheart,"If Australia does a successful tour of Pakistan, the impact it&#39;ll have on  cri ket in the country will be no less than the kind of impact a world cup victory has on the game in a country... Provided they tour with their A team"
6GUKBe6Y0dw,ShapakEntertainment,Very important for both Pakistan and Australia to play with each other and also for world cricket to play with tough opponents
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Matt OToole,"No, they shouldn&#39;t tour Pakistan, until a Pakistan govt repeals S298."

6GUKBe6Y0dw,Abdullah Siddiqui,Australian Players are always welcome in Pakistan 🇵🇰
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Unlimited Learning By Malik,Pakistan is a very Safe country....
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Fed_Express,Loving having Michael Vaughan back on Fox. It&#39;s unfortunate how he was taken to cleaners without even being given a chance to have a fair trial at Yorkshire. I&#39;ve always loved his analysis and hope English broadcasters grow a pair of bloody balls and let him come back in the UK in summer.
6GUKBe6Y0dw,JUST MERIT,Khwaza... Better he plays for pakistan..  immediately leaves Australia and join pakistan team.. but he will not...
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Faizullah Khawaja,Aussies thrashed England. Let&#39;s see if they dare to face Pakistan in Pakistan.  That would be a real test for them playing on unfavorable surface against a strong emerging Pakistan. We dare you Aussies...
6GUKBe6Y0dw,Jotendra Kumar,Risky  playing in pak.  Sri Lanka  knows it well.

Mhb8sQoumjA,rameshnat27,Just went back and listened to the commentary. Mark Taylor actually is the one who first mentions that it&#39;s Siddle&#39;s birthday. Warne as always creating a narrative of his own 😀
Mhb8sQoumjA,Peter Nguyen,"man I wished Ch9 back in 2010 had the cameras in the commentary booth to record the commentators reactions <br>Would be great to see Bill, Tony working behind the mic"

9Tudt_SwlLY,Lee Turton,I was watching live on channel 4 ..the bottle bret lee showed for Australia was amazing... Flintoff was bowling fast and nasty hitting lee repeatedly on the body but he couldn&#39;t remove him... even the Kasper ball wasn&#39;t really out 😆

Oi2SdV3DF0s,LOL,Is losing or drawing any different in terms of the World Test championship?
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Cricket Hit,great to see Andrew Symonds another fearless cricketer
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Saad-The-Editor,I think those tactics were good for pakistans perspective because of their collapse in 2 session their was alot of reverse swing now Australia have not enforced the follow on and Pak can lose or draw or maybe even win this match
Oi2SdV3DF0s,LawanGeen Khan,Marnus 🤪🤪🤪🤪
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Brad,Very poor from Pakistan the pitches and the tactics it&#39;s almost as if they don&#39;t want people to play in Pakistan

Oi2SdV3DF0s,Sajid Kazi,CUMMINS GREAT LEADER AUSTRLIA TEAM
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Sajid Kazi,austrlia is lione
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Ameel Dezi,Poor and defensive field placement on day 1 and 2 by Babar was the main reason why Australia scored 500 plus and then appalling batting....<br>Babar can&#39;t put pressure on Australian batsmen by giving close fielders to spinners or pacers.......
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Zalan Pir,Which tactics Pakistan do not know anything they just play they do not any plans
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Nandan Singh,Pakistan is making cricket look bad &amp; boring game. They shamelessly instructed commentators not to talk about pitch.
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Max S,"Happy for Isa Guha, she gave Warne credit to help her get better at her commentary and broadcasting skills. And sad Warne left us for his heavenly abode. Best wishes from an Indian"
Oi2SdV3DF0s,MoSa,Pakistan is wary of Aussies bowling attack and they prepare dead road pitches. Pak is not strong enuf to play top4 teams. Cant even trust their own strength and beat a visiting team in their own homeyard.😂
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Rajesh Raman,"LOL  Just say one word , these overrated aussies will shut up every holes in the human body and that is INDIA 🇮🇳"

Oi2SdV3DF0s,ali khan,"So who decided to drop Yasir shah and bring back hasan Ali?<br>Rameez should be sacked for just these wickets.<br>I dont see Imam,Abdullah, Azhar and Fawad resisting this australian attack.Rizwan and Baber may not be enough."
Oi2SdV3DF0s,BryanP,"I see Isa, I click! ❤<br>But seriously, if Pakistan is slowing the game, means they also won&#39;t win it..."
Oi2SdV3DF0s,MELODY MUNRO,The wickets for first test and second are not conducive for exciting cricket ...  2nd test will be a drawn out draw too.
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Aaqib Akbar,Brilliant tactics by australia <br>Batting all 2 days for 500 runs lol
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Raxta Emu,"Love khawaja.... Also i want to pat Andrew Symonds bald head, is that bad? 😌😺😺 Good punditry and Isa 🔥"
Oi2SdV3DF0s,Zeeshan Ali,Who cares... its test cricket. End it already

Oi2SdV3DF0s,harris aziz,"Stupid tactics from Pakistan. Awful captaincy bowling negative lines. This was supposed to be a historic series, its only going to be known as a dead rubber."
Oi2SdV3DF0s,ma7ur,It is terrible they are not promoting test cricket they are destroying it
Oi2SdV3DF0s,ali noor,Missing Andrew symonds long healthy curly hair

ONUELwbvGIc,Parashara Ramesh,Pakistan is a road 😂 Anyone can score a century there . The real subcontinent conditions are found only in India and maybe in Srilanka
ONUELwbvGIc,SigmaLife,This has aged well 😂😂😂
ONUELwbvGIc,Nitin Satish,I reckon Aussies will rethink on their statement that they are ready to take up India in India...<br>FYI : India retained BGT 2023 within 5 days (2.5 days each for 2 Tests)

ONUELwbvGIc,Priyanshu ,I hope you so called cricket experts get your answer today<br>Playing in India is not equal  playing in Pakistan<br>My cricket advice to Australian cricket respect other team because some day your team will be in their backyards and do not complain then if they give back taste of your own medicines well we give extra bonus too
ONUELwbvGIc,Chiku,Australia never beat India in india specially test series actually no other team no one atleast compite

ONUELwbvGIc,Bul Thaosen,Except you will rarely get flat and dead pitches in India.
ONUELwbvGIc,Michael Myers,"Brad Haddin , it&#39;s okay to dream but absolutely foolish to do so in broad daylight. Nevertheless it made me laugh. I actually shudder in fear knowing what India does to teams at home, also knowing what they did in Australia 2 years ago. I can only imagine what  Rohit Sharma &#39;s India is going to do to Australia when they land here less than a year from now."
ONUELwbvGIc,Bhaskar Ghosh,Pitches in Pak were like roads so huge runs..that won&#39;t be the case in india..pure turners and world class spinners
ONUELwbvGIc,Leonav,Australia should first beat India in their home now...... Pakistan wickets and Indian tracks are two ends of a spectrum !  And Indian batsmen who love spin will fominate the games......the ausies pace attack will be neutralised.
ONUELwbvGIc,Herman Sehmbi,What a joke. Keep dreaming. White wash in store
ONUELwbvGIc,Aryan Raj,"Seriously Playing Sajid, Nauman and  Others bowlers on flat pitch and playing Ash and jaddu on turning Wicket is two different things and Playing Shami and Bumrah when is the ball reversing is even more tough and India not gonna play with the run rate of 2.60 ."
ONUELwbvGIc,danish ahamad,Cannot wait for this series to happen! I hope it outshines the last one! 👍🏻
ONUELwbvGIc,amit rao,Waiting for pant vs Lyon contest
ONUELwbvGIc,gamer arena,Laughable
ONUELwbvGIc,TOSEEF QAMAR,hahahhaaha....when pakistani bowlers reversing the ball.....it was ball tempering......now they have learned and saying art of bowling and its called reverse swing....<br>wasim akram....<br>what a double standard of these people.......
ONUELwbvGIc,Udayshanker Kalikiri,Our strength is spin and unlike pakistan we will give the pictches which is our strength...if aussie spinners are up for it then it will be a tight contest🔥
ONUELwbvGIc,MAHESH KUMAR TAK,Looks like they have legalised drugs in Australia.
ONUELwbvGIc,Samarth79,Lol take as much as reverse swing u want it will not mean anything when face ASHWIN AXAR JADEJA  etc lol.COME TO GABBA COME TO GABBA
ONUELwbvGIc,Nishit Kashyap,"Australia would be lucky if they even manage to get a draw in India , they would need another awful Indian collapse to have a chance to actually win a match"
ONUELwbvGIc,Amol Sankulkar,if Aussies thinks Success in Pakistan = success in India for Aussies then they are living in fool&#39;s paradise. Haddin saying about against India in India without any confidence they are worrying about against India in down under.
ONUELwbvGIc,Rahul Shetti,"&quot;Come to India, and I guarantee you that it will be the last series of your life&quot; . Once, Ash had said this to a 3rd grade temporary captain of Australia. 😀🤣🤣"
ONUELwbvGIc,its_her,Nd here I m guessing who won in Australia in last two series
ONUELwbvGIc,A Sinha,grapes are sour for aussies they cant win in India so making up things lol
ONUELwbvGIc,SRD,"No offence guys, but Australia will get spanked in India 4-0. I really don&#39;t see them winning a game. Pakistan and India are two very different cups of tea. I doubt you will get a single deck like this. And with due respect, the current Pakistan spinners aren&#39;t very good. Once you get into the cauldron with guys around the bat and with the drop and revs of Ashwin, the accuracy of Jadeja and Axar, it&#39;s one of the hardest things to face in the game today. There&#39;s a reason India has won 15 consecutive series at home. Even the great Australian teams didn&#39;t have that good a record at home. And yes, Aus fought hard in 2017 and the series was close, but I just can&#39;t see them winning a game. India&#39;s lower middle order is too strong at home. Guys like Pant, Shreyas will destroy the spinners."
ONUELwbvGIc,Game Of Geopolitics,Aus and Ind in World test championship Final ...... 🔥🔥🔥
ONUELwbvGIc,suraj cricket,Forgot about winning in india considering the performance in pak..ball is not turning here at all.and another difference is the ball we use sg ball which turn more with bounce
ONUELwbvGIc,Asim Javed,"Indian pitches will offer more spin. I don&#39;t think Australia could win easily in India, I think India will dominate."
ONUELwbvGIc,Dinesh Kuldeep,"It&#39;s quite a funny conversation that they are comparing same pakistan and Indian pitches. Most of pakistan pitches are flat surface, no swing, no spin, no pace, reverse swing can be good if you have skills. Indian pitches are mostly spin friendly and sometimes reverse swing friendly on day 4 or 5. Just try to don&#39;t allout below 100 if Ashwin or axar are in mood at Chennai, Delhi, ahemdabad"
ONUELwbvGIc,x,Steve Smith ❤️😀<br>Mza aaenga 😌 ind vs aus
ONUELwbvGIc,MARK FAR,Forget Aussies success in Indian Soil........They will not be able to win even a single match in the upcoming series.<br>😝😝
ONUELwbvGIc,Shahram Ijaz,right now only pakistan can beat ind in ind
ONUELwbvGIc,Tanwir Zafar,Less did they know that they are playing against baber azam
ONUELwbvGIc,Subhan Ahmad,Where is the last 2 days analysis video? 😹
ONUELwbvGIc,Jeet Singh,Winning in india🤣😂.. kuch bhi
ONUELwbvGIc,Andre george,Test in India will be more difficult as This time it will be Axar along with Jaddu and Ash and Bumrah also compared to 2017
ONUELwbvGIc,Jon Snow,Waiting for your video about Babar&#39;s historic 196 innings
ONUELwbvGIc,Another Stoic,Success in Pakistan=Success in India!! 🤣🤣 Are you comedy me 🤣🤣!!
ONUELwbvGIc,Ashish Kuvvarapu,Haha i have a feeling this won&#39;t age well😂
ONUELwbvGIc,Tariq Ismail,Thanks Aussies for touring Pakistan. We r enjoying to see your super team playing on our grounds.
ONUELwbvGIc,COMPARISON SPORTS MAINLY,Babar&#39;s avg was just 44 plus before 2and test
ONUELwbvGIc,Akash Datta,"Which team Isa guha supports? Australia, England or India? Hard to understand"
ONUELwbvGIc,Aditya 007,"you are complacent by success on Pakistani flat pitches. India prepares turning tracks. Non-Indian pacers are toothless on Indian rank turners. As regarding spinners, Ashwin troubled you in Australia. In India he, axar and jadeja will come in your nightmares. With Pant XD."
ONUELwbvGIc,Indian,Oh safed kapra ohh Ye log Dead pitch mei khila rhe hai tumhe and when you will come to India then you will get Turning tracks and English team was also confident when they came to India 🙃
ONUELwbvGIc,RANDOM CLIPS,What about now 🤣😂😂🤣
ONUELwbvGIc,R Jayanth Jadhav,Pitches in Pakistan are exactly like MCG. Flat decks.<br>Indian pitches are way more spicy
ONUELwbvGIc,Harish G,Spoke too early huh
ONUELwbvGIc,Prateek Yadav,Lol this video is aging like milk. Pak need 126 in 17 overs with 6 wickets in hand. I hope Pak goes for it! Would be fucking fantastic.
ONUELwbvGIc,Ankit Sinha,Come with all the winning momentum to india.We will see you there😉
cQORhPzUUw8,S D,Nasser is a gem with the mic tho ❤

cQORhPzUUw8,Vortigan07,"We certainly did love him here in The UK! Not just because he&#39;s arguably the greatest cricketer to ever play the game and that we were there to witness that in the flesh. Even more than that, we over here in The UK love Warney&#39;s personality type, what the Aussies refer to as a &quot;larrikin&quot;. Loved a drink, loved a smoke and a good party....and still turn up the next day <b>always</b> with the very real threat of being more than capable of destroying any side almost single handedly. It&#39;ll be a long time before we see his like again!"

cQORhPzUUw8,Darren Wilson,"I can tell you why England loved him. Because he was flawed but brilliant. I cried when I heard the news. I was at Edgbaston absolutely slaughtered after drinking too much too quickly, in 1997. I was singing &quot;Shane Warne takes it up the arse, doo dah&quot;. He turned around to me, smiled and gave me the wanker fist shake sign. I was absolutely honoured that he&#39;d acknowledged me and bowed down to him. Thank you Shane for your brilliant ability."

cQORhPzUUw8,Auction Direct Flowers,"Spent most of my young life watching England losing to Australia hating  Shane warne for being too good for us, as I got older grew to respect his amazing skill and encouraged my son to watch him on YouTube as he tired to bowl leg spin. After a days cricket at the oval 5 or 6 years ago I saw him crossing the road as i left the ground. Approached him and explained my son was trying to be a leggie and asked for his autograph.. “have you got a pen” he said “no, I’m sorry” I replied.. “have you got something to sign” he asked.. “no, I’m sorry” I replied. We both laughed and he said, so kindly “no worries mate come to my car” had a great conversation about how much pain he had caused over the years and when we got to his car he signed a programme for my son… an amazing cricketer but in a few moments showed what a very nice person he was.. down to earth and humble.. RIP.. am so sorry for his family, a huge loss"

cQORhPzUUw8,Mark palmer,"As an English cricket fan we hated watching Shane coming on to bowl because we knew it meant we were going to struggle but we loved watching him bowl as well because he was a genius &amp; the best bowler we have seen.<br>Since he moved into the Sky commentary box we have also got to know him better which has made us love not only the Shane the bowler but also the man who seemed genuinely warm and caring and was full of joy whether that be commentating, coaching or on the sky pod cast when it was just mates chatting.<br>The world is a much duller place without him &amp; the English cricketing public will miss him dearly."

hFM4ZhOvQmI,Aryan Upadhyay,New Zealand is the best team to win the cup but let&#39;s see. Beciz in 2015 world cup and 2016 T20 world cup they were top in their group but choked in final and semifinal respectivelllllly

hFM4ZhOvQmI,Arko Ray,I think Finch will have a good tournament. He knows that this is going to be his last international assignment so there is no pressure on him to perform. He will enjoy playing in home conditions and would want to finish his international career on a high infront of his home crowd. <br>Australia along with England are the favourites to win this T20 World Cup.

hFM4ZhOvQmI,Hassan Nadeem,"Not a great analysis on Pakistan tbh. The middle order is def crappy, however the bowling attack Isn’t just good, it’s the best in the World Cup. Shadab is a master spinner and saying he’s ok, is an insult. He gets the wickets and creates chances when needed. And yes babar and rizwan are the key to success. Nawaz should be promoted up the line up for sure. And fakhar should play one down."

gN_tYrp1XiI,Md jasim uddin Shah,"I think, Australian cricket team don’t&#39; who is shakib al hasan. Mr. 75 no.1 all rounder in the world."
gN_tYrp1XiI,Sahil Raheja,How finch forgot bhuvenenhwar kumar 🤣
gN_tYrp1XiI,Monoj Das,Why did no one talk about Mitch Starc ??
gN_tYrp1XiI,Legal Man,INDIANS CAN NEVER APPRECIATE LIKE AUSTRALIANS ARE DOING😂THAT&#39;S WHY THEY HAVE 5 WORLD CUPS THEH ACCEPT FACTS AND WORK ONN...NO ANDHA BHAKTI😂
gN_tYrp1XiI,Zidan Mabrur,Shakib is criminally underrated
gN_tYrp1XiI,Sreejith Sreeju,Joe root
gN_tYrp1XiI,Sumit Phougat,Only virat kohli  koi compare nhi h
gN_tYrp1XiI,07_047_0a,they ranked all rounders? didnt they know shakib? This guy will retire as one of the most underrated but best players in the history of cricket.
gN_tYrp1XiI,you can call me saqqi,Babar ❤
gN_tYrp1XiI,Aditya Chawla,Kane Williamson ❤🗿
gN_tYrp1XiI,Muhammad Osman,babarazam is the best player
gN_tYrp1XiI,Nishant Singh,The way Rishabh has kicked Lyon&#39;s a** in his small career. I think he should always take his name😂😂😂
gN_tYrp1XiI,aimen Aftab,I liked that they are appreciating Babar Virat Smith Root but am also surprised that any one of them don&#39;t mentioned Kane Williamson in batting list  mean he is a true legend and all format player and In bowling it was unbelievable that they forget Shaheen Shah Afridi in that list
gN_tYrp1XiI,𝐑𝐎𝐘𝐀𝐋 𝐊𝐀𝐍𝐍𝐀𝐃𝐈𝐆𝐀,Why babar here😂😂
gN_tYrp1XiI,Black,I don&#39;t know why Rohit so underated he is a star player far better than others except vk
gN_tYrp1XiI,History Ball,Where is Sakib Al Hasan?  He is not only best in batting but also bowling.He is better more than Virat and Babar. Because Sakib is best in 2both things Bat and ball. So I think he is best
gN_tYrp1XiI,Islamic Shorts,"Batsman:Babar,Virat<br>Bowler:Hazelwood,Shaheen<br>All rounder:Shakib,jadeja"
gN_tYrp1XiI,Islamic Shorts,where is shakib ul hassan
gN_tYrp1XiI,Mr Mam,The question of all-rounder answers itself...The dangerous Ben Stokes
gN_tYrp1XiI,dave crook,"Cummins, Root &amp; Bumrah &amp; Stokes for sure, after that it&#39;s difficult to pick another 1 from 5-10 valid candidates...personally i&#39;d go with Jadeja as i just love him!"
gN_tYrp1XiI,Faiz Mohammed,Rohith Sharma ka naam lelo koi?🤔
gN_tYrp1XiI,blair mcbride,The disrespect for Kane Williamson is unbelievable the man averages over 54 in test cricket.
gN_tYrp1XiI,Shijin Varghese,I&#39;m  shocked nobody took the name of kane williamson...
gN_tYrp1XiI,Hassam Tariq,Baberazam no doubt is a best player currently
gN_tYrp1XiI,Dean Gooch,Roooooooooooot
gN_tYrp1XiI,Louise Rawle,"Virat Kohli,Steve Smith hands down!!"
gN_tYrp1XiI,Steroloefc84,Steve Smith once a cheat always a cheat
gN_tYrp1XiI,W J,Babar Azam is one of the best current era players.  Babar is great to watch. Reminds of Mark Waugh which was a great player in the early 90s. As the great Imran Khan said about Babar Azam some years back that he has great temperament secondly exceptional natural talent and thirdly shot selections great.
gN_tYrp1XiI,Melon Farmer,Finch is the most expressive speaker
gN_tYrp1XiI,Amit Saha,It&#39;s really shame not even speak about the guy like sakib al hasan.14000+ international runs 650 plus international wickets but still not recognized by the Australians.What a pity!
gN_tYrp1XiI,Shais Khan,Aron finch great player
gN_tYrp1XiI,Paras Oli,BIG BEN
gN_tYrp1XiI,gtanj,"Kohli has been going down the hill for some time now, his test average has plummeted below 48.5."
gN_tYrp1XiI,M K,Maxwell &#39;Johnny Bairstow&#39; lolololol
gN_tYrp1XiI,Sui Ronaldo,Weird how they said Kohli… he’s terrible now
gN_tYrp1XiI,Shah Arnab Chisty,Shakib Al Hassan all rounder!
gN_tYrp1XiI,Art Pereira,"Hey, Steve!! I need to replace my broken door but the new one might not fit. Can you send me some sandpaper?"
gN_tYrp1XiI,Vaibhav Arya,No mention of Rohit Sharma😂😂<br>And then there are some idiots who say Rohit&gt;  Virat🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
gN_tYrp1XiI,Scott Ryan,Labushane looks like a kids drawn a picture of the biggest cheats in cricket
gN_tYrp1XiI,P S Bhagath,Vk❤
gN_tYrp1XiI,Retrorampage,Cameron Bancroft
gN_tYrp1XiI,vinod iyer,Smith best in tests virat best across formats kane best under pressure root very street smart
gN_tYrp1XiI,Sánchez Boy,"Oh come on. That’s a very simple question. The No.1 Batsman in the world is Liton Das, the No.1 Bowler in the world is Mustafizur Rahman aka The Fizz and the No.1 All-Rounder in the world is Shakib Al Hasan. End of discussion."
gN_tYrp1XiI,waqar ahmed,"Among all these greats, Pat Cummins and Baber Azam are the best mannered. Do i even have to mention the obvious one and only worst mannered here?"
gN_tYrp1XiI,ijaz Malik,wtf bumrah doing there ?NO AMIR NO STARC NO SHAHEEN ?
gN_tYrp1XiI,SuperEdge67,Kohli is over rated……..I’d pick Kane Williamson before him.
gN_tYrp1XiI,Dinesh Chauhan,When Marnus speaks it feels like someone is crying 🙄
gN_tYrp1XiI,KUSAL MENDIS 13,Kohli in india.... yes best in india....
gN_tYrp1XiI,David M,"Best batters in the world. 1. Steve Smith 2. Kane Williamson. 3 Kohli/Root/Marnus/Babar all pretty even. Steve and Kane are  clear outright bests in Tests in particular, Steve is best though which I don&#39;t like admitting since I&#39;m from NZ"
gN_tYrp1XiI,Ajay kumar,Aussies appreciating virat Kohli 🔥 nothing new they respect who deserves.. we all know how dominating Australia is in cricket ♥️ smudge best test batsman of this era .
gN_tYrp1XiI,RUSHI-RAJ VLOGS,Unfollow aron finch right now..
gN_tYrp1XiI,AB LFC,"Everyone bangs on about Kholi, there are many Indian Batsmen that were better than him, clearly Sachin and even Rahul.<br><br>Root is one of England’s best batters, but I personally think Steve Smith is the best Batsman I’ve ever seen.<br><br>Not discrediting Bradman, but never saw him."
gN_tYrp1XiI,Sunethma Jayaweera,I love how they appreciated Ben Stokes ❤
gN_tYrp1XiI,ZARIF,Stokes is great clutch player but come on!! Its utterly ignorant to talk about goat all rounders and not mention shakib. In white ball cricket he&#39;s the greatest allrounder of all time and is pretty far above the rest. 7000 odi runs (avg 37+) with 300+ wickets in 220ish matches. Highest t20i wicket taker of all time with 20+ average. It&#39;s beyond ignorant and it seems like there&#39;s a deliberate attempt to hinder his shine. WHO TF ELSE DESERVED PLAYER OF THE TOURNAMENT IN 2019 WC MORE THAN SHAKIB?? Men lie women lie stats dont. Ure allowed to be entitled to ur dumb opinions but don&#39;t mistake facts for fiction.
gN_tYrp1XiI,Freddie Webber,Lyon slowing diving into a depressive state after Mentioning Ben Stokes name
gN_tYrp1XiI,Jenny rei Simoi,I think Steve Smith currently the best batsman in the world.

Ihxbfx6eFv8,AK14,Fox cricket should broadcast all international matches allover the world
Ihxbfx6eFv8,PICCEC,Woooooh
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Ats kj,Technology used in cricket Australia is top notch. I think Indian broadcaster should upgrade thier technology as well. The DRS system is very slow during IPL or Indian matches in India
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Faiz Mohammad,Man I love howieee
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Ashish Gouda,How can i pursue a career in this anyone
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Prince Zuko,Now I understand why the matches broadcast in Bangladesh is so poor. Because they don&#39;t have that technology since they can&#39;t afford it.
Ihxbfx6eFv8,James Trainor,Howie brings so much energy
Ihxbfx6eFv8,guccimaneplayschess,Super interesting to see behind the scenes!! Would love to see more stuff like this from Fox. Their broadcast team is very dedicated and you can tell they love making high quality broadcasts.
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Sharpy,"Very informative, but where was the loose unit who operated Spider-Cam?"
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Transition Transverse (TT),Moneyball pro max ++ Vibe🔥🔥
Ihxbfx6eFv8,veryfrozenwaffles,"This is awesome! Thank you, great tour!"
Ihxbfx6eFv8,dos dosington,Howies a real one. He really would appreciate every single person in that truck which not everyone TV does
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Joel Jadhav,Indian broadcasters would never show us such content
Ihxbfx6eFv8,James B,Wow all of that tech just to broadcast a cricket game. Thanks Fox Cricket for the insight.
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Mihir Deep,All this goes thru… and yet I sit on my fat ass with a glass of Pepsi and a bowl of chips watching it 😂

Ihxbfx6eFv8,Crickanni,Shame on star sports pathetic quality
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Damien Mason,Zero crowds so I guess Fox has to promote it so ppl pay for it lol.
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Rajiv Bhaskar,Been waiting for a video like this. Really liking sports broadcasting for a year now👌
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Allocators Asia,This is legit one of the most interesting things I&#39;ve watched this year. Incredible!
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Eamon Gleeson,"In my view Its a double edge sword for Broadcasters. On one side they pay the money to have the rights to broadcast and they also spend a gazillion bucks to provide the production value we see in Tech, Wages, and consumables.<br>On the other side they have to recoup some cost from Tickets and advertising, but because the production value is top quality, less spectator attendance is happening because you can immerse yourself in the broadcast."
Ihxbfx6eFv8,joshua samuel,I just love the video ❤️.  Such a cool tech. Thanks Fox cricket for this video. Much needed one for the fans.
Ihxbfx6eFv8,HNisCrazy,Tommy speaking like he is crying
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Gian Barroga,"Quality coverage, Howie;"

Ihxbfx6eFv8,ShaneDR009,This was an awesome little piece. Thanks to the unsung heroes who bring us a great coverage!
Ihxbfx6eFv8,Kookedaburra,Crazy how much goes into a broadcast for every single game of cricket

skwr29y-2p4,Parth Saxena,"Miss you Warne, gone too soon 💔"
skwr29y-2p4,Divendu Ghati,McGrath and Warne were on whole different level.
skwr29y-2p4,Vantheman12 3,Warne and McGrath
skwr29y-2p4,The String Theory Podcast,Please respect the GOAT combination please
skwr29y-2p4,Tony Montara,In this era you rarely get to see 4 bowlers in a side with 200+ wickets each. This speaks volumes about their longevity in playing together where they compliment each other really well ❤🔥
skwr29y-2p4,Samrat Ghosh,"Warne, Gillespie,lee,glenn is the greatest attack of all time in cricket so the answer is no brainer 😂"
skwr29y-2p4,NPD,"Omg, this video is a joke - Lara would’ve spanked these current kunts around park."
skwr29y-2p4,Prateek Ojha,"Cummins = Macgrath, Starc &gt; Lee, Warne &gt; Lyon, Hazelwood &gt; Gillespie. I&#39;d have Macgrath, Warne, Cummins and Starc as my four bowlers in a test match."
skwr29y-2p4,IzzyYouTubing,"Is this a joke? The current bowling group are great front-runners, but too often fail to knock the opposition out to be comparable to Warne/McGrath in anything other than purely statistical terms."
skwr29y-2p4,Andrew Westcott,Kasprowicz  at his best &gt; Lee t his best.  He should be in the comparison.
skwr29y-2p4,Patrick Johnson,"This is comedy gold lol,thank god,this wasn&#39;t a serious question lol😂. Warne, McGrath,Lee,Gillespie all day everyday. If T20 Cricket was big back when they played,they would have won 3 of those aswell."
skwr29y-2p4,Daniel Smith,Is this even a serious question 😂😂
skwr29y-2p4,Arush Dayal,"How is this attack even comparable to their early 2000s attack, when India&#39;s beaten them twice now in their own conditions (while ALSO outbowling them)? Let&#39;s not get carried away. Mcgrath and Warne are both legitimately in the GOAT conversation."

Why not ?<br>If you talk about average then KALLIS averages better than sachin. So you rate Kallis higher than sachin ?<br>What a joy to watch, i remember how every run Lara scored made my day.<br>Lara was on 374 and he needed 6 to equal Hayden&#39;s record of 380 ... tell me which batsman would come out of his crease and hit the ball straight for a SIX to get to 380. Only LARA could something like this while his counterpart crawl to a century."

Nice useful video!Thanks to Brian!👍"
YeR8u20cxCA,Blackdawg,Best batman I’ve ever seen
YeR8u20cxCA,Danny mahé,"One of the greatest classiest batter to ever play the game, Lara in test matches is a masterclass. What a legend he is. My uncle loves his gameplay so much he named my nephew after him. And the surprise is I&#39;m from south India. That&#39;s how much influential Mr. Brian Lara is."
YeR8u20cxCA,Shagun Kaushal,I rate sanath Jayasuriya and Sehwag ahead of Lara or Sachin
YeR8u20cxCA,sushanta biswal,I am watching the video for 5th time.MrBRIAN LARA is genius.
YeR8u20cxCA,triple5,Brian was at the tail end of the greatest cricket team ever. The 80s WI team was just astonishing and we got to see them nearly every summer in Australia. They were so popular a large section of The Hill at the SCG actually supported the Windies. And now we have to get down on our knees to them? What nonsense. No one loved the Windies more than Australia.
YeR8u20cxCA,sushanta biswal,"Hat&#39;s off MrBrian LARA ,class act,the only word is perfection.Two legends I have seen MrMichael Jackson &amp; MrBrianLara"

YeR8u20cxCA,Ratel.H Badger,This masterclass lasted longer than the recent test match.
YeR8u20cxCA,Zaid Muhammed,"People talk about Sachin bring great but he was good because he batted around top class batters,Lara had probably like 8 bums he had to bat with,the shots he played no batsmen came close to,broke records,set them,greatest in terms of man army"

Absolute delight for people who watched them play. 90s era was the most skillful era in cricket. Today it&#39;s just power hitting with heavier bats and shorter boundaries and powerplay, free hit and what not.<br>The only thing that I feel has evolved in cricket in a better way is fielding."
ypwMV7neRrQ,Harsha Raj,Lara❤
ypwMV7neRrQ,Ifran Galib,Last one was definitely 6 <br>In a 60 metre boundary.

ypwMV7neRrQ,ranjeet kumar,West indies still needs him
ypwMV7neRrQ,aniket padewar,Even in net practice Mark Howard’s commentary is insane and better than many of his peers…
ypwMV7neRrQ,GoProDiaries,"Bro you are bowling to a 53 yrs old legend, go easy. you ain&#39;t getting a prize lol"
ypwMV7neRrQ,ES,This guy is a pure prodigy. Even at this age he has not lost his potential !
ypwMV7neRrQ,Humair Dawood,Trust me he will score him 500 runs and still be playing 😄 Lara was and will be the best test batsman ever!
ypwMV7neRrQ,Saiid,Still the best WI batsman. He could come out of retirement and still be #6.
ypwMV7neRrQ,kshabu26,My gaaaaad.. Laaaraaaaa...
ypwMV7neRrQ,Truth Satya,Old retired Lara against a bowler in his prime .

ypwMV7neRrQ,@bgmientertainment,Wild card entry to West Indies test cricket🏏🏏🏏🏏
ypwMV7neRrQ,M19 Y,Glaring difference between today’s cricketers vs the golden age cricketers.<br><br>This dude’s line is bad and he is currently playing international cricket.<br><br>You give the ball to any golden age spinners today and they would ball better<br><br>Glad i stopped watching cricket in 2003 because today’s cricket isn’t a real cricket to me
ypwMV7neRrQ,Ollie Fowler,Fairly sure that Brian would still average 40 opening the batting for WI if you asked him to do so tomorrow morning.
ypwMV7neRrQ,Ali Hyder,Left  hand Best batsman saeed  anwar lara is  no

ypwMV7neRrQ,Satwik Deshpande,The last shot was an easy 6 on current grounds
ypwMV7neRrQ,Abdullah Faruq,"At the age of 50 myself i have seen many great and genius basman. Even i saw Viv and Sobers, gavaskar, Javed Miandad from early era (collecting video caset from British Council). But to me Prince  Brain Charles LARA is the best of the best. Style of batting, Fearless Stroke making Along with patience, game reading, bowlers mind reading ability and use crease to make shot all around the field make him a complete package of all the genius batsman playing before, in his tme and till now. No one can match him. No one. No one. <br>In my life i never miss hiw any Innings whether it is test or one day. The innings of 153 against Australia still make me feel goosebumps. ❣️❣️❣️"

GiyCmtFOFF0,A canofbeer,"England fan here. Shane Warne was our nemesis along with the likes of Steve Waugh, Glen McGrath, and Brett Lee and others. He was a magnificent bowler and game changer. It’s so sad that he died so young because he had so much more to offer to cricket. Mentor, tutor, commentator and just a nice bloke are some of the things we will all miss out on. Sadly missed but always appreciated 👌👍"

Bought stickers of Gilchrist, Shane Warne,  Andrew Symonds, Ponting along with Sachin and Ganguly from the book and stationery shops. How good it felt  Cricket that time. Whenever India lost to Australia, tears came to the eyes. But we loved cricket and we love dyou. Thank you for making our childhood so beautiful. Today when we are losing you forever, those emotion comes and catches the corner of the eye through the tears. Rest in peace our Childhood heros of cricket 🏏."

GiyCmtFOFF0,Jess Gizza,"Gilly shed tears pays heartfelt tribute Roy and Warnie his mates. <br>Andrew Symonds (9 June 1975-14 May 2022) was an Australian international cricketer, who played all three formats as batting all-rounder. <br>Commonly nicknamed  &quot; Roy&quot;,  he was a key member of two World Cup winning squads. <br>Symonds played as a right-handed, middle order batsman and alternated between medium pace and off-spin bowling.<br>He was also notable for his exceptional fielding skills. <br> <br>Shane Keith Warne  ( 13 September 1969-4 March 2022)  was an Australian international cricketer, played as a right-arm leg spin bowler and a right-handed batsman for Victoria, Hampshire and Australia. <br>He is one of the greatest bowlers in the history of the sport he made 145 Test appearances, taking 708 wickets,  and set the record for the most wickets taken by any bowler in Test cricket, a record he held  until 2007."

GiyCmtFOFF0,Rishabh Aniket,I recently read and found about Symonds’s life. The guy was a  out and out legend and a man of fierce loyalty. So sad.
GiyCmtFOFF0,Phe Mus,True Blue legends! 💔
GiyCmtFOFF0,Laurie Morton,I&#39;m a kiwi who very much dislikes everything about Australian cricket but that video actually made me shed a tear. In all honesty everyone knows Warney was a top bloke and I would say the goat of spin bowling while Symo also a GC was well before his time with the style of play that  he took to the crease and field. I hated watching them take nz apart consistently but as a pure cricket fan I was left in awe and just held so much respect for their incredible talent. Gillie has my respect too because he would always walk which cant be said for 99% of crickerters worldwide these days or back them. Both Warnie and Symo will be terribly missed. May they rest in peace.
GiyCmtFOFF0,Tech Tips,Indians hated them beacuse they always use to find some or other way to beat india...but over the years due to ipl we came to know more and more about aussie players and we loved them....we too miss them
GiyCmtFOFF0,blantyre60,Cricket fans from the rest of the world like myself really miss them too! The sport is clearly poorer with their absence!

GiyCmtFOFF0,dhanunjay achar,It&#39;s really hard to see giily in tears but they are worthy..
GiyCmtFOFF0,Feral611,"Grew up watching Warnie and Roy play and loved them both. Then getting to listen to them commentate was always entertaining. Summer just isn’t the same without them and never will be again.<br><br>Seeing Gilly so upset automatically puts a lump in the throat. Brilliant tribute to these legends even though I watch it through tears. R.I.P. Warnie &amp; Roy, two greats of our game."
GiyCmtFOFF0,Judi Venten,Remain heartbroken that the King &amp; his offsider are gone - Warnie carried his genius into commentary - just LOVED listening to all he had to say. Other commentators should listen to what he said - about the commentators curse - Truly - Cricket will never been the same.
GiyCmtFOFF0,Mark Wick,"They are lucky India pays so well , when was last time stadium full for these fools In Australia ….grubs"

XukgvD5cq5A,Chevy Dyall,I think the reason for him being the best is he plays for the team to win
XukgvD5cq5A,thatsbollox,"I&#39;d also be chirpy if i was ranked number 1 in the world. <br>He&#39;s alright. Bit of overacting sometimes, but tolerable. We&#39;ll see how he truly goes when he hits a run of bad form."
XukgvD5cq5A,SSJ94,Australian and English cricket have a level of production quality that is simply unmatched. I wish Indian cricket would adopt the same standard.

CLqzEJO11CU,C.l.E,Rip to a true champion and legend of the game Shane warned😭😭😭
CLqzEJO11CU,Rob Lee,"Those 2 and many in the era while on the field played against each other like I did with those from opposition teams i got along with, fierce competitors not giving an inch but always the first bloke you shook hands with after the game or cracked a beer with"
CLqzEJO11CU,Chris Doran,Warnie you were my cricket hero and that’s coming from a Pom. Love hearing a fellow legend speak with such class about his rival and friend. Still so strange that your innings was cut so tragically short 😢
CLqzEJO11CU,Joshua Hong,"Warnie is, and always will be, desperately missed…a class act on and off the pitch. It’s going to be so different and hard having a Boxing Day Test at the ‘G without his voice presiding over it. His innings was cut way too short..rest easy, Shane. You were, to me and millions of others, a true inspiration. Thank you."
LZhEuHhFe20,Machine gun,"Love warner from RCB,lore❤"

LZhEuHhFe20,Abhishek Priyadarshi,"David Warner opening with Virat Kohli for same team would be the best left hand - right hand opening pair combination of these times. Add the aggressive nature of both, there could be some extraordinary powerplays"

LZhEuHhFe20,airtestman,Didn&#39;t that guy  cheat?
LZhEuHhFe20,Abhishek Priyadarshi,Warner is definitely one of the top 5 left hand batsmen in my list
LZhEuHhFe20,pk pavankalyan,"Being an admirer of virat kohli , still , I dont think he has the better body than ab devilliers...Abd is fast , quick between the wickets, has a better reach and strong legs than virat...and also more athletic on the field...so Abd in Abd&#39;s body is just as perfect as it can be...."
LZhEuHhFe20,MnM,"How&#39;s your Hindi?<br>Ben Stokes: well, my name is a famous hindi word and Kohli uses it all the time"

LZhEuHhFe20,Shubhendu Das,"Magnificent player, Goat Warner 🙌<br>He is not Celebrated much like Abd or Steve Smith or Virat Kohli but he surely has much much greater place in my list,  not as much as other goats but surely he is a goat 🐐 in his own league"

U0IU671jEfA,What's Not To Hike,"Even months and months later, Shane Warne still leaves a massive gap in the cricket world. His career should be taught in schools. His bowling, his respect and his commentary after he retired is all first class. No matter what the situation, he ALWAYS looked for a way to win. Not draw, not take a dignified loss. Always to win. You have Elvis in music. James Dean in acting. Shane Warne in sport. The future generation will never really truly know how great he was."
U0IU671jEfA,prabhakar sagar,He&#39;s alive in our hearts bidoo

U0IU671jEfA,Jesse Valeri,It just still doesnt feel real that he&#39;s gone. His death makes me feel kind of guilty for not cherishing every day and doing something with my life because Warnie was one of the good ones who loved life and now he&#39;s gone.

7iNkXRPnf9Q,the analyst ,If mark and Steve played from india they would had more runs and records than sachin and ponting.
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Randy Schwing,Who remembers the GM Diamond?
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Rishu Sverige,Big bats and small boundaries have taken the sheen out of cricket. Those 4s and 6s are enjoyable only if they come once in 3 overs or so.
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Fernan Jovian,"Surely it matters who has the biggest Stick, but it matters helluva lot who&#39;s swinging it."
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Supreme God Emperor Donald Trump,"Imagine Jayasuriya &amp; Aravinda with these bats in 1996, Sir Viv in the 80s etc. So many bowlers would have been retired lol"
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Perfect Zone,"There was a bat which was used by Andrew Flintoff, Kevin Peterson  Tilakratne Dilshan with Cut sides. Edges of bat were cut. Mmmm that bat name was Wood Worm May be. I believe that was the most Morden bat specially used by all rounders and power hitters. And off course mongoose of Hayden in the list."

7iNkXRPnf9Q,Mark Harrison,I swear Huss touched the handle when he put the bat down
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Lee W,Don&#39;t touch the handle. Touches the handle
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Scholesiefirsttime,Imagine being able to test bats like this (before you buy)?!<br><br>That would be a fun hour or two!
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Nick Jones,"God, the way that these morons are touching the antiques. Rubbing the autographs, stickers, etc. Their finger oils are gonna destroy it all."
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Assinine Comment,"Weird to see Waugh being so indifferent to the condition of the grip - on not just the third, but any of the first 4 or 5. <br>Also weird that Hussey didn&#39;t understand the full purpose of the G.N. (super) scoop. <br><br>Tbh, it seems like they were in two rounds, at the Members&#39; bar 15 mins prior to this segment."
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Souvik Sinha,David Hussey walks off with a limited edition bat 😂😂😂<br>He seemed to be so enthusiastic with all those bats - starting from the oldest one in the lot. What a genuine chap.
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Gregory Kemp,"Interesting, Clive Lloyd must have known his stuff, a bigger/fatter handle gives you a bigger sweet spot, imagine what would happen with a very thin handle and you hit the ball off centre, the bat will want to twist in your hand! Also the scooping out the middle of the bat, transfers more weight to the edges/sides, this makes the bat more stable with off centre his as well. The same thing with tennis rackets. Yonex brand have a bigger sweet spot due to the their isometric shape, more weight on either side and longer cross strings top and bottom."
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Michael Larkin,Got priceless signatures so yeah Howie fondle the bat...idiot
7iNkXRPnf9Q,jibsmokestack1,Presenter super annoying. Great to see Mark Waugh
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Hafiz Janjua,No touching! dont grab the handle! Put it back! 😅 like a school teacher at home with her kids.
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Richard Smith,Great to see them with the bat named after Clive Lloyd. People forget just what a hard hitter he was. If he had the modern technology his average wold have been substantially higher.
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Tony W,scoop was peripheral weighting like golf clubs!
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Ersalan Arif,Imagine if Bradman had these newer bats. Would average even more than 100. Shows how far above everyone else he is
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Hari,"If it get thicker and wider, it’s not good for bowlers it will become uneven game"
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Deepak,"Wow, Indian cricket should take lessons from Australian media"

7iNkXRPnf9Q,Mohsin Ali Khan,I love mike hussy batting
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Greatgoku4,Howard stop over reacting its not like hussey was going to damage the bats. He is a gentleman and has great control over his arms. You ruined the vibes
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Sujith,"I saw the video in my explore page, opened it and immediately went to the newest tab under comments. I knew what I was looking for and I found it.<br>If you are seeing this, you’re probably looking for it too. If not, bc bat ka grip nikalke. HATT HATT"

7iNkXRPnf9Q,Shovn Kazi,Make my day ☺️
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Neothings,"Back in the 12% moisture content was standard because they just did want to deal with the return... Pro -cricketer you get away for lower moisture but bats are retired earlier i.e the they don&#39;t keep for years... 1% moisture equates to about 1oz / 1mm overall willow on the bat.  If you take that ounce of a certain areas, only on the edge or middle you get more then 1mm of wood so pro-bat alway look bigger.... The next bit is concave, they move wood for the middle area by scoping it to add it to the edge, it is just con, the volume/mass is same it just in different areas.  GN Scoop were the pioneers of this....  That big edge design / the scoop helps with off centre shots because it helps to reduce energy loss due to twist.  Most batsmen/women want to hit out of the middle not the edge, so is a big edge helpful not really unless you aren&#39;t great.  It is akin to the golf and game improvement irons, they are helpful for the newbies but it doesn&#39;t help if you want to shape and control a shot"
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Ayman Kalam,Excellent video I like the dsc bat it’s the bat that sangakkara also uses
7iNkXRPnf9Q,MG,One bad thing in cricket is cricket ball . There is no cricket ball longer years than bat .  As a bowler That is sad one 🥺🥲
7iNkXRPnf9Q,gbthrylos,"The old classics : Symonds Tusker , V100, SS Jumbo , GM maestro , DF Magnum, Kookaburra Ridgeback , GN Twin Scoop and Dynadrive"
7iNkXRPnf9Q,gbthrylos,Could have done better with bats chosen. Would have been nice if they through in a Tusker or Dynadrive. Also the Jumbo should have got a run
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Tom Cooper,Convicts
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Dhritiman Das,Pretty nostalagic.. We grew up watching these bats used in cricket game especially i were a fan of GM &amp; V slazenger series bat.. Funky stickers
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Michael O'Neill,That six off Dan Vettori was the sweetest of sweet sounds
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Tim wilde,"Looking at all those heavyweight bats only makes me hark back to Bob Simpson&#39;s time as coach, when he tried coaxing a number of players to go back to lighter bats because of the proliferation of modern batsman getting caught in slips. His view was that heavier bats made it more difficult to adjust for lateral movement, especially off the pitch. <br><br>We live in an era of flatter pitches and pace bowling that&#39;s the meat and potatoes of modern cricket, with a bit of spin thrown in. Bradman played in an era where medium pace was at it&#39;s zenith (think Alec Bedser, who bowled what Bradman claimed was the best delivery he ever faced) and spin bowling was king - to the day he died, he still claimed Bill O&#39;Reilly was the greatest bowler he ever saw or faced. So there was much more lateral movement off pitches that weren&#39;t as well protected as they are today, meaning that a lighter bat would have been more advantageous for last millisecond adjustments. <br><br>So with all that said, I think modern heavy bats (which Graeme Pollock popularized to the likes of Greg Chappell) are fine for minimal movement that uses the weight to stroke the ball to the boundary off pace bowlers, but for all the people who ponder what Bradman could have accomplished with them, I suggest they go and look at the full flourish of his stroke play in video clips, plus his lean and diminutive frame - he&#39;d have practically fallen over trying to wield a modern bat. Every bowler who ever faced him said the same thing, that what set Bradman apart from others was the fact he &#39;saw&#39; the ball yards earlier than other batsman - I&#39;ve always put that down to the game he used to play for hours as a kid with the stump and golf ball. A heavier bat would have slowed down his reaction time and negated that advantage somewhat of seeing the ball so early."
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Sandesh Uttam Patil,Sunil gavaskar while doing commentary in a match said &quot;when we played we had bats with edges nowadays players mistime their shots and ball goes off from middle of the edge.&quot;
7iNkXRPnf9Q,Nn J,I think hope you had Sachin Tendulkar bat

sNUIxybTGyk,Harris Abilash,"Lara, Tendulkar in batting, Kallis as a all rounder, wasim and macgrath as pace bowler, Warne and Murali as spinner. These are many other good players, However the above mentioned is some of the  greatest of all time."

oH9mnAfXp_k,Bang Bang Gaming,Australia should play in streets of nagpur Or delhi cuz in their the ball spins more than anyother international venues cuz venues will be watered <br>If u wanna prepare for spin they go to small grounds where locals play ball spins more than any other international venues <br>Advice for Australia;

oH9mnAfXp_k,Amir suhail 🇮🇳,Even these people are scared 😂
oH9mnAfXp_k,Sid 179,Aussies are at the same stage India were in the 2020-21 series after first test. Do they have the mettle and wherewithal to stage a come back in a similar fashion with their benchstrenght. They would have to suffer a few injuries first to make a like for like comparision. 😁
oH9mnAfXp_k,Arka Sengupta,"What they campaigned before test, it&#39;s not sporting. It&#39;s ugly. Shame that they don&#39;t take their accountability."
oH9mnAfXp_k,Soumik Chatterjee,"I get a feeling that the Aussies will bounce back, that loss surely gonna hurt them badly, as proud Aussies they should be eager to prove a lot of predictions wrong, it&#39;s an action replay of India&#39;s series down under, the Aussies are going through the exact mental agony which the Indians have gone through pro 36 episode @ Adelaide. How the Aussies react to the present situation gonna determine the outcome of the series. It&#39;s a cracker of a game awaits in Delhi...that&#39;s a given....I never liked an attitude to troll opponents, instead give utmost respect to the opponents, and when your oppossition is Australian cricket team, it&#39;s not a matter of joke, you gotta be weary of their counter attack. Some of the Indian media outlets and Indian legends of past are behaving exactly the way Aussie media and their legends reacted after India&#39;s 36 episode, Indian ckt team gave them a befitting reply by displaying outstanding ckt in next matches to clinch the series. There is no reason to believe Aussies can&#39;t replicate the exact reaction, so India should forget Nagpur and prepare to face even tougher test at Delhi..."
oH9mnAfXp_k,Jean Paul,"Drop Lyon, my Aussie Spinners would be Todd Murphy and Zampa. Lyon was inaffective against India in the past series also"

oH9mnAfXp_k,arun prashad,When someone says ashwin is home bully yes he may be. But give a name who dominated more than ashwin I&#39;m bowling in India. Even kumble and harbajan were smacked for runs in India sometimes of thier career  but i have never seen ashwim was dominated by someothers in India. He even improved in Australian conditions. Got Steve Smith in Australia twice at least.
oH9mnAfXp_k,Prasanna Venkataraman,It’s just silly how Australians and Brits always demand for home conditions when they tour India. Absolute cry babies.
oH9mnAfXp_k,A-man,Kangaroo ready for 4-0
oH9mnAfXp_k,AIKA gamers and sports,Steve Smith best of luck
oH9mnAfXp_k,Shreyes,"Most of the comments are from indians, i think except indian subcontinent, cricket is not popular in any other country, football and rugby are more popular in england, besides Australia is good in many sports like rugby, association football, Australian rules football, whereas india is good in only one sport that is cricket, still we have not won a single icc trophy since 10 years"
oH9mnAfXp_k,wasiq m.k,"Try to use Travis head instead of warner as head can provide you some part time spin option as well,and again if khwaja has problem use renshaw as an opener!<br>My playing 11 for next test!<br>1.travis head<br>2.matt renshaw<br>3.marnus<br>4.steve Smith<br><a href=""http://5.cam/"">5.cam</a> green<br>6.alex Carey<br>7.pat Cummins<br>8.nathan lyon<br>9.todd Murphy<br>10.swepson<br>11.mitchell starc/hazalwood"

As per our sources Bangladesh used their VETO power to block this resolution!!!!! Indian prime minister Modi thanked Sheikh Hasina in this regard in a phone call between two leaders!!!!!! BCCI chief thanked BCB in this regard and guaranteed two picks at the smallest league cricket in the world!!!!!! I forgot the name of the league, something like IPL..... Antony Blinkon stated that Australian ally USA moved their 7th fleet to the shore of Bay of Bengal to counter India&#39;s two missile system named FarhanJADEJA and PreASHWIN as per sources.......Alan Border stated that if Aussie want to play like this change the name of the tournament to RANCHO - GAVASKAR trophy from BORDER - GAVASKAR trophy (as per sources)"
oH9mnAfXp_k,K_Banerjae.,Good to listen all are talking about performances not t pitch. India scored 400 in decent track n utilised t condition. Well done team India👏!!!🇮🇳
oH9mnAfXp_k,Sudhir Dahiya,Is that Allen Border in the middle ? 🤔
oH9mnAfXp_k,Jace Da Ace,Amazing result for India against the #1 test Nation in the World. Hard to see any other nation catching either Australia or India for the final of the World Test Championship in a few years&#39; time! Looking forward to the rest of this series...

oH9mnAfXp_k,bollyBob1980,"When Rohit registered his century, Australia was leading by a single, they were too complacent when bowling to Jadeja &amp; Patel. Their fields were passive, their catching uncharacteristically sloppy, Murphy shouldered too much &amp; came through superbly. The second innings capitulation was inexcusable: Australia need to turn ability into aptitude; Head needs to replace Renshaw; Warner needs to be assessed, perhaps Handscomb can bat higher between Ussie &amp; Head. The bowlers need to bowl more accurately. It started well on Day 2 with half of India dismissed &amp; focus declined causing an ultimately disastrous result. India were great; Australia are a great team &amp; need to be better."
oH9mnAfXp_k,free speech,If cricket australia pay me million dollar i will ensure aussies win in india in few years and after that they will never lose in india. What is the secret?  You need a great spinner .  All he has to be is young and tall ( 61&quot; -6 2&quot;). Too tall then their kneeds ankles will be weak and cant bend back. Any spinner who dont bend is not great spinner. Ashwin is a floater . he excels when ball dont bounce.
oH9mnAfXp_k,free speech,"Australia can have 5 spinners , it do not matter. GAME is won by score board pressure. Even bad spinners can take wickets. Aussie batting against indian spinner is deciding factor.  Indians are good player of spin. You need two excellant spinner and one Kevin pieterson to take down india in india."
oH9mnAfXp_k,free speech,Problem with aussies are openers. They need to drop one atleast and make travis head open. You need uptempo game to put pressure back on india.  Even wicket falls. They need to be aggressive.<br><br>Timid play ? Indian spinners eat you up.<br><br>I predicted aussie win 2-1.<br><br>They need to make changes and fast. <br><br>Can the new change make any difference? Depends on openers.<br><br>Two left hander is a no go.  Ashwin will eath them up in spinning low bounce wicket.<br><br>Its a totally different in aussie condition where ashwin is kinda useless. Reason is ashwin cant bend and back problem.<br><br>Aussies needs to score more runs against indian fast bowlers and get a good start.<br><br>Also indian spinners are not scared of Aussie middle order. <br><br>Aussies needs to bring new set of batsman.  shaw and comb are useless in spinning condition

oH9mnAfXp_k,DEEP SHANKAR Karmakar,Fox cricket is the main culprit. They were the ones who distracted their team by negative coverage of pitch.

H1qaecQZGl4,Ashish Garg,Why you australian always cheat?? Don&#39;t you have a little bit shame. You cheated with india now with England. Have some self respect at least.
H1qaecQZGl4,Jaspal Singh,How we get to listen this commentary panel in india
H1qaecQZGl4,Sameer Thapa,Wonder how Australia played in Delhi with AQI of over 300 ?? They must check their lung doctor
H1qaecQZGl4,Nishant Ranjan,Funny how they crib about turning pitches and conditions… as if it’s a surprise. They have one of the best spinners in Lyon so why they seem so surprised about balls spinning .
H1qaecQZGl4,Mukesh Nehra,"Whenever India plays badly in foreign conditions this is the thing they also do, they also get out inside 30-50 overs like in newzealand or in Australia sometimes"
H1qaecQZGl4,H R,"The difference between India and Australia is that Australia play with 11 players and India play with 14 players, 9 batsman and 5 bowlers.."
H1qaecQZGl4,Sandeep Singh,Mr. Cricket was always in the form in whole career.
H1qaecQZGl4,Ravishanker R,"Only difference between aus and Ind is players like jadeja , Ashwin and axar who score in Indian conditions. Nothing else . Aus can easily win against India."
H1qaecQZGl4,Dave Routley,To bad the rest of the side should of come home also.. They were SO Cocky when they BEAT low side Sth Africa and West indies. But the truth IS when they play top sides they struggle . 😁😁😁😁
H1qaecQZGl4,Kalaivani Murugesan,4 in 4 wow india wins in australia last 2 tours are just jaw dropping especially the last one and india winning at home is no big deal... 😎
H1qaecQZGl4,Sarvagya 7619,"India shouldn&#39;t invite Australia to Indian shores, they can&#39;t play spin, absolute useless against Ashwin-Jadeja duo and don&#39;t forget Axar who brings absolute carnage if not with the bowl then certainly with the bat. If BGT happens it should only happen in Australia, atleast India competes there, wins one or two test matches. As far as Australian team in India is concerned a test match barely goes to 4th day forget about any fight or competition from Australia, an overrated team who can play well at roads at home, can&#39;t win in India."
H1qaecQZGl4,Mahesh Shilimkar,Border Gavaskar trophy goes ton India <br>And WTC trophy goes to Australia 😂😂😂
H1qaecQZGl4,Sid Som,"For test cricket to survive, ICC needs to focus on introducing synthetic drop-in pitches across all test-playing countries, minimizing the home country advantage due to vastly different pitch conditions from country to country."
H1qaecQZGl4,abhishekpt 10,What is so unbelievable ? Anchor says India has won 4 in row!!! This attitude has got Australia in position where they are now
H1qaecQZGl4,IN2047,India always played well but now India seems like a champion in cricket because of the improvement of umpiring due to technological advancement.
H1qaecQZGl4,sakthi vel,How india retains bgt Trophy when only 2 matches were played out of 4. What if aus won the remaining 2 someone explain?
H1qaecQZGl4,pavan kumar,Hopefully our boys make it Hatrick in Australia. Because in india we can win doesn&#39;t matter whoever is in opposition and expecting a white wash in these series.

H1qaecQZGl4,Arindam Talapatra,Why not playing practice matches when there is a 10 day gap between two matches?
H1qaecQZGl4,Subham Sarkar,Suji hay Australia 🦘🦘🦘🌏🌏🌏
H1qaecQZGl4,Govindarajan Narasimhan,All this will be forgotten and Australia wil go back and think about retraining the Ashes but if they want to be really world no 1 they have to beat India in India ; but what is surprising is none of the top teams is taking this seriously and taking is as a project to best India. They have to invest in spin and find good young spinners and train them realy hard otherwise the result will repeat again and again.Are they willing?
H1qaecQZGl4,shailendra chauhan,So it took the hosts a time of just one test match to retain the Border Gavaskar trophy. That&#39;s pretty impressive !! 5 days of sheer clinical performances and dominating cricket. <br>TEST Cricket is the BEST cricket

H1qaecQZGl4,Bhaskar Balasubramaniam,"I think Cummins did not do his job astutely. His 2nd inning batting was like that of west indies tailender, absolutely horrendous. A very appaling type of captain, rightly either ran away or was booted out of remaining matches."
H1qaecQZGl4,Iam bisu,4-0
H1qaecQZGl4,Gowrishanker V,"No screaming, no denunciations, no talking down. Forthright discussion, incisive analysis. No pulling punches either. They call the spade a spade. Most Indian so called experts r incapable of this. And, TRAGICALLY, when a critic like Ravi Shastri-a rarity- says something candidly, most find him immensely unpalatable. Most Indians love benign, goody goody blather. I dare say that I am in for some flack."
H1qaecQZGl4,Dass,Only sucessful batter was Mathew Haden of 2001 series who had runs before both Fast ballers and Spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan. And Steve Waugh as captain in that series. I still remember the pink cloth which waugh kept during difficult time playing facing West Indies fury Fast bowlers Curtly Ambrose  Short pitch off side movement and his bowling partners in W.I. in 1995.(Best  Cricketing battle)- H.S.
H1qaecQZGl4,Dass,"Sir! We Indian fans welcme Australia in India. Hope return of Stark and Cameron Green. As Number 1 fast bowler in Australia, Pat cummins has underperformed in 2 tests. Batters have Underperformed. Only Khawaja looks better opener to some extinct.- H.S."

H1qaecQZGl4,Raghav E,Aussies used to intimidate the umpires and get results in their favour. But after DRS that old ploy is totally useless

H1qaecQZGl4,TheLibran38,"when India went to Australia in 2020/21, in the last test, Indian bowlers had 13 test wickets among them, while the Aussie attack had over 1000 wickets. <br><br>There is probably no one reason for the Indians &quot;owning&quot; the Aussies...I think at this point the Indians are living &quot;rent-free&quot; in Aussie heads 🙂<br><br>And to think that neither Bumrah nor Pant are playing..."

H1qaecQZGl4,Noel Kanaparthi,I’m thrilled that India won….but Pat is my favourite bowler…..Hope he’s well.
H1qaecQZGl4,tamoghna das,KL Rahul is actually undercover Australian agent. He has taken it upon himself to make the games competitive (bu throwing his cheap wicket)
H1qaecQZGl4,Sugato Roy,what about Zampa ? He has always bowled well against the INDIANS especially against Virat Kohli. He may  be considered only as a T20 and 1 Day specialist but the fact is that he is a good spinner and knows the playing surfaces well in India. A known devil is always  better than an unknown devil
H1qaecQZGl4,Him123,India has proven again that they are the best in all formats of cricket whether in india or overseas. <br>They simply outclass any team in the world. They deserve all the accolades and praise.
H1qaecQZGl4,Shubham Tiwari,"Imo, only issue here is with mindset of Aussie cricketers. They ain&#39;t trusting their defence, they gotta trust their defence and spend time on the pitch, I believe they will survive, we I&#39;ll see a good test I guess ,not one sided demolition."
H1qaecQZGl4,Kabir Abrol,"You said you are great when u play home but lost at home couple of years ago , not against India 🤣🇮🇳"
H1qaecQZGl4,Kabir Abrol,"Doctoring of the pitch 🤣🤣🤣 mate unbelievable 👏  india 🇮🇳  ,  who the he is this old man🤣"
H1qaecQZGl4,Kshana Surya,"The below stats shows how  poor and substandard they are in Asia and aren’t intimidating like these Ex - Aus pundits who always believe and brag  day in day out that they can win in any condition by only considering how they play in their own backyard. <br><br><br>Out of 29 test matches from 2008 in Asian Sub continent won only 5 test matches. 2 Against Srilanka ( 1 in 2011 , 2nd jn 2022) , one against Pakistan ( 2022), One against Bangladesh (2017), and against India ( 2017/2018). Rule out the win against Srilanka in 2022 , we know they are a young team in transition. Win against Pakistan we know how a road of a pitch it was and how mediocre Pakistan was in their own home ground."

H1qaecQZGl4,Ben Soham_93@Manchester United,Just to calm Aussie people Indore and Ahmedabad pitches are not gonna turn from Day 1 or 2
H1qaecQZGl4,Aniket Sawant,1 positive for Aussies is the selectors will back KL Rahul
H1qaecQZGl4,Arun Bahadur,Oz should have waited to loose the ball its hardness and zip then they could have played aggressively and put pressure on indian team
H1qaecQZGl4,King 👑 kohli,I like it&#39;s afraid 🤣🤣
H1qaecQZGl4,Kevin S,The biggest change as AB said was DRS especially in low bouncing and spinning tracks like in India. I think the results could have been very different if DRS was not there. <br><br>Even the umpiring has changed. When teams have reviews left the ump was hesitant to give out. As soon as Aus was out of reviews the ump was calling everything out forcing India to use reviews.
H1qaecQZGl4,sudhanshu ranjan,Jadeja rarely speaks or sledges on the field but he is the least diplomatic in the team. Speaks his mind.
H1qaecQZGl4,Xinnie the Pooh,Ig fox didn&#39;t find any clip of Jadeja tampering with the ball this match.

H1qaecQZGl4,M B,"Aussies look scared, India hasn&#39;t even produced dustbowls yet.<br>And i don&#39;t think they will need it, the Aussies seem to fear even if it turns just a small bit.<br>Disgraceful preparation."
H1qaecQZGl4,Venkatesh S.Raman,The big problem with most teams today is they try to play T20 cricket all day in a Test Match. No one can hit like that for long in a test match. Playing that way for half an hour is different from playing all day.
H1qaecQZGl4,sn raghuraman,"Playing Starc would help in creating rough outside right handers . Even though it will help Lyon against our  batters , it will be more useful for Ashwin to exploit. Just a perfect spot for Ashwin . Welcome Starc"
H1qaecQZGl4,vip,Why are they uploading these bullshit. initially thought its the game highlights
H1qaecQZGl4,Mick Curry,"Pathetic. The &quot;Curse of Justin Langer&quot; is upon us. What was the ACB thinking allowing the players to virtually sack the coach. Bring back Langer to instil some discipline and concentration back into the team. The players, by their casual, sloppy attitude  have shown they have no respect for new coach Andrew McDonald."
H1qaecQZGl4,MIR SYD,"Apart from mental preparation.. Aussies need to improve their ball selectionn decisively.. And work on step out to counter spin, finally work on defesive technique with straight bat to kill d spin.."
H1qaecQZGl4,Suraj Karkera,The worst is still awaiting the Aussies in Ahmedabad test they won&#39;t be able to play axar there .
H1qaecQZGl4,AjitPS,"Aussies premeditating a lot with the sweep. Not thinking on their feet and adapting. Delhi required more back foot and flicks. Not just brainless sweeping every time. Torrid batting. @foxcricket<br><br>Also Jadeja is an ace allrounder. Future legend! So underrated as everyone is obsessed with quick bowling allrounders like Cam Green, M. Marsh, Hardie and Stoinis.<br><br>Stokes and Jadeja are true greats in all 3 skillsets and all 3 formats."
H1qaecQZGl4,Noel Chamberlain,Nothing pleases me more than to see the Aussies floundering against a quality side 🇬🇧🇬🇧
H1qaecQZGl4,Placemats,"England are going to have fun with the Aussies,can&#39;t wait to see them weep"
H1qaecQZGl4,sunil dabrai,T20 has taken a toll on test batsmanship skills. Batters have forgotten the art of defensive play.<br>They are not able to focus and concentrate for long periods of time.<br>It is a forgotten skill now. I remember of times when batsmen could bat defensively for an entire day without scoring too many runs but not losing their wicket.
4973MQard9o,Different Videos🤣🤣,ALL Games Here MY channel YOUTUBE 🎉❤😊
4973MQard9o,Ajai Kulkarni,4th Test will show if Virat Kohli has steel
4973MQard9o,Michael F Beilby,Perfect opportunity to make some money in India betting on the cricket. Sorry to detract from the Aussie performance but really - India dismissed for 108 on their own pitch…
4973MQard9o,Peter Clark,"First two tests pitted Aussie arrogance against a proud and competent side. Remove the hubris and a match closer to form results. Happens time and time again. A lack of professionalism is inherent in our touring teams, all codes, all sports."
4973MQard9o,Afzal Basha T,No doubt Australia has dominated <br>It&#39;s not so good to see two 5 day test matches between two top teams getting ended in 3 days
4973MQard9o,khaleel khan,It&#39;s becomes routine when you win it&#39;s mere talent if loses blame on pitch . Anyways India needs to develop a balanced pitch with helps good fast and spin and decent batsmen too
4973MQard9o,ATUL DWIVEDI,one of the thing is Australia ignoring is that Australia didn&#39;t played a single practice matches before taking the first test. that was backfire for Australia at first test 2nd test day on the money but the loss the match on the third day.
4973MQard9o,💥વોરિયર 💥,Steve Smith most popular caption in India.
4973MQard9o,Manish Raj,Steve Smith captaincy was the difference...I l appreciate Australia winning ....sometimes plans needs to backfire for betterment of test cricket
4973MQard9o,امپورٹڈ حکومت نامنظور,Endians an there third class pitches
4973MQard9o,Syed Arsalan Ahmad,"India lost the match cz Axar Patel didn&#39;t score. Our top order and Middle order is useless, wins have been largely a creation of the lower middle order. There is no Pant and Jadeja didn&#39;t score either"
4973MQard9o,Aashu tiwari,"It&#39;s only happens once in every 20matches, which is ok. In the last 10 years india have lost only 3 test matches out of 40"
4973MQard9o,anuj golesar,Fox cricket literally doing clickbait using virat as thumbnail 😂😂😂😂
4973MQard9o,Jayandran M,Congratulations to assuies
4973MQard9o,Humble_Boy1984,Well played australia always there in series just missed in first two ....... 🙏Travis head six to ashwin was the best one
4973MQard9o,Pratyush,"If we can beat Australia in Australia, then I don&#39;t know that why BCCI and our management can&#39;t trust our team to beat Australia on &quot;normal&quot; home pitches. But nothing to take away from the Aussies, they were the better team right from the 1st over of the match till the last. Huge credit to Smith for his clever and spot on captaincy"
4973MQard9o,Muthukumar Rajendran,Aussie will win as this Indian batting line up is pathetic as last two matches won due to tail not top order batsmen . The expectation from tail Enders are huge both in terms of bat and bowl . Is it fair ? Can’t these batsmen play spin that too in home ground . Pls refrain from comparing these batsmen with any of our legends who played better than these bunch
4973MQard9o,Offred,In their first innings Australia lost 6 wickets in 11 runs. I dont know what australia is rejoicing about.<br>Steve Smith was fun to watch though
4973MQard9o,Ven Stomon,Brilliant win for the Aussies..congratulations
4973MQard9o,Miths India,"Forget complacent ,if you even be careless with Australian cricket team they will take the game away."
4973MQard9o,Sanjeev DD,One factor across all three matches. Team winning toss and batting first has lost each of these matches.
4973MQard9o,Gregory Russell,Ha ha India 🤣🤣🤣

4973MQard9o,A Mode,Controversial thought - cricket venues should be band to host international test cricket if their average game duration over a day 5 to 10 year period is less than 4 days…
4973MQard9o,Gannu Maharaj,Worst spin pitches or not I always believed that Australia wud have won the series 3-1 this time.<br>Still glad that it wud be ended at 2-2 😉<br>👍👍<br>Wud have been super happy if kangaroos won the series 3-1 against this overrated loosers 👎👎👎<br>Anyways Congratulations Aussies in advance 👏 <br>U guys deserve it🦘 🔥👍
4973MQard9o,Basudeb Bhattacharya,"What to review? If the world ranked batters continually fail is it not the high time to kick off them n say straight a good bye? What for Virat Kohli in the team? If during the need he fails successively doesn&#39;t other deserve chances? Rohit, the famous captain, the famous batsman, if he plays in T20 style in a test match does he deserve to be in the side? So long such poor management n poor selection committee will be there there&#39;s nope. Kick them out. Just a solid kick. They shd not be entertained to make records in a day. Feel shy to see their actions before matches. Nonsenses"
4973MQard9o,Sona Gabbar,Dravid maybe a good batter of his times but he is equally an incompetent coach and don&#39;t have any tactical acumen to make things happen. Axar Patel is by far the best batter in this series and he should have been promoted up the order at least in second innings.
4973MQard9o,Raj Sahu,"I&#39;m very very disappointed with the third rate pitches we are making . Even my school matches pitches were better !🤠😃 These are sub standard horrible pitches where no good team gets a real chance to play. It&#39;s amazing such poor and substandard pitches are even allowed to be made!  Both the legends Gavaskar and Vengsarkar are furious that test matches are not lasting more than two days ! It&#39;s a mockery of cricket . In my 60 years of age I&#39;ve never seen such horrible wickets in India which were known to help spinners , but they were sporting enough to last all 5 days giving all bowlers a good chance to use their skills and the batsmen to exhibit their talent. Poor show 😞"
4973MQard9o,Franklin james,"I&#39;m so excited, my life has totally changed since I invested with $10000 and I now make $35700 every 14 days.."
4973MQard9o,Saiful Islam,Indian Batsmen were toothless infront of Aussie bowlers.
4973MQard9o,Angad Singh Johar,"Australia were absolutely magnificent in this game. Nice analysis guys. But I disagree with the fact that the pitch nullified the skill of the Indian batsmen. The fact is, they are not up to the quality of previous generations in terms of playing spin: e.g. VVS, RD, Sachin, Haydos and Junior. That’s the kind of quality required and these guys are way off the mark!"
4973MQard9o,Manish kumar,Its blessing in disguise Pat cumming is out of series...he is Expert bowler on bouncy track but dont suit at all in india...strac or hazlewood better in indian pitches...selection was issue in last 2 test...Warner Cumming Rensaw simply dont fit ...
4973MQard9o,Siddesh Parab,Hmm…..Looks like the pitch was under construction….
4973MQard9o,Balu Sai ram,"It&#39;s a poor statement from you guys stating that the pitch is bad, You guys must and should have to play even in these kind of turning tracks instead of express highways and bouncy pitches at aussie, if you need to become an ICC Test Champ. It&#39;s a small thing even India loss this match Rohit stated that batters need to find a way to be more consistent on these pitches to play significally."
4973MQard9o,jovesheerwater,"It would be nice to see some footage of actual play, not just people talking. Why is this not possible?"
4973MQard9o,Jatin Chawla,Steve smith is born captain. This test has shown what captaincy change can do to the team whose back is on the wall before the start of the match!! Kudos to Steve!!
4973MQard9o,hardik parbhakar,it&#39;s batting vs batting in this series whoever bats well wins simple
4973MQard9o,hardik parbhakar,wasn&#39;t he in india today how the hell did he get there so fast do they shoot this in india?

4973MQard9o,GK Ariga,"Who knows,either Karma caught or fixed match"
4973MQard9o,Shubham Maskara,Not yours and not even our captain u put kohli on thumbnail just to get clickbait
4973MQard9o,shylo85,"As an englishman im glad the aussies have won and hope they win the last test. The pitches are disgraceful, conditions should always be tough away from home but these pitches are a joke, the turn and uneven bounce on day one is laughable..."
4973MQard9o,Amit Kumar Tiwari,AUS have only issue that&#39;s batting lineup nd form of top order.....!!!!
4973MQard9o,Ibrahim Ambrose,"Smithy, the best captain for Australia after Punter!<br>🔥🔥🔥"
4973MQard9o,Rajesh Ashwatthama,"Steve Smith pockets should be checked for any kind of Sand Papers , once a cheater always a cheater"
4973MQard9o,Swapnanil Das,Admittedly they are good analysts...
4973MQard9o,Darkstar,India deserves this loss🤣
4973MQard9o,Mahbubul Anam,It&#39;s called caught in your own spin trap....Lowsy pitch!

4973MQard9o,PandiyanRevathi,Congratulations Australia I am very happy .I am indian but my favorite team Australia criket ♥️
4973MQard9o,Kriss W,They played better because it was a couple of more days since they played 20/20 games which is how they played i the first two.
4973MQard9o,UDDIPTO SINGH,Why do the Australian cricket experts never appreciate Steve Smith more. None of these experts from any era have a better batting average than smith. Neither of them  have an uniform average all around the globe. And now even about his captaincy which was in real the drastic difference that showed in the results today is not appreciated more. Whereas in India.. All the commentators and experts could not stop heaving praises upon smudge. Get a life u aussie experts. In India smith is loved than what u all are loved back home.
4973MQard9o,Mark Clarke,This wicket will obviously be rated as poor and unfortunately due to how many stadiums India has will have no effect on India.
4973MQard9o,Mark Clarke,Of course it backfired on the worst cheating cricket nation on the earth.  And so it should have.  Learn how to win without doctoring your pitches you morons.
4973MQard9o,Saurabh Kumar,Well diserving win for aus congratulations
4973MQard9o,Manish Rathore,Steve Smith fit permanent shoes for captaincy.. but Rohit frustrates like American woman
4973MQard9o,Jack mag,You want aus to be successful going forward <br>Keep smith as captain<br>And keep head as opener
4973MQard9o,Rohan Kolekar,Great captaincy by Steve Smith
4973MQard9o,potdar kapil,"Kohli better score or givebtest retirement I can&#39;t c him playing this much horrible, I am fearing thag his career avg jn test will be under 40 , if selectors falsely back him, currently from 55 avg he dropped to 48, it going horribly wrong for him <br>I think he is not interested in playing test, <br>Only interested in playing some matches taking rest, &amp; taking central contract money"
4973MQard9o,troy sharma utsav,Great Team Australia ❤️❤️❤️
4973MQard9o,TOP 7 ,Who thinks Steve Smith&#39;s should be full time TEST captain of Australia??
4973MQard9o,AK,"I am an Indian supporter, but really happy that Aussies won this match. I am really sad on pathetic condition of Indian pitches which is killing beauty  of test matches.  Congratulations to Smith n team. All the best to Rohit."
4973MQard9o,Punk,It&#39;s the problem of being too predictable always with Same bowling combination of spinners no oppertunity for Kuldeep or Jayant instead of pacers who&#39;s spot seams useless and don&#39;t ask me question of Umesh getting wickets in this pitch coz any bowler who can pick wickets especially a skiddy bowler like Umesh who has very low bounce...<br>Acc to me Axar Patel is as good as Ashwin and Jadeja in this condition but poor Rohit don&#39;t trust him as a bowler giving him very less number of overs and taking him away soon his record as bowling in test cricket is phenomenal especially in these conditions.<br>So Kuldeep needs to be back or Jayant Yadav keep changing thinks.
4973MQard9o,Sardar Umair,"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23foxcricket"">#FoxCricket</a> Smith should be the permanent red ball captain !"
4973MQard9o,Tony Walker,Capt Cummings no more?
4973MQard9o,MrBazuka,"T20 has literally killed the fun in test matches,why are these matches getting over quickly,the batsman these days lack the patience to play the long format and stick around for a long time, everyone likes to score quickly"
4973MQard9o,Andy Mic,India is a choker in pressure situation. Soon aus ll beat them in wtc final to taste them their own way of winning test matches in home soil. Wining knockout matches isn&#39;t everyones cup of tea. 😂😂😂😂😂
4973MQard9o,Jay Jay,"Smith should be captain, woke cricket australia needs to stop bending the knee.<br>Cummins is a rubbish captain but great wokester!"
4973MQard9o,EchoChamber,The toss is not infact irrelevant. The first session on any day is the worst time to bat
4973MQard9o,Sunil Kulkarni,Australia did win pune test in 2018
4973MQard9o,Mayank Dewli,So happy that India lost.  I hope this will give them a valuable lesson and they will not prepare such horrible rank turners in future. India is killing test cricket
4973MQard9o,Sports Enthusiast,Steve Smith a genius
4973MQard9o,B G,Steve Smith inspires his team members to a different level.He is a delight to watch during his action on the field and during presentations.What a gem!
4973MQard9o,Leader of no one,"This is going to sound crazy, but we should bat second more often."
4973MQard9o,Jehan Ariyaratnam,"Australia weren&#39;t prepared for the first test, and injuries didn&#39;t help, especially Green creating that balance"
4973MQard9o,anslem almeida,Steven Smith...great captaincy
4973MQard9o,Rhythm Mehra,Thumbnail of virat to criticize him🤣🤣🤣
4973MQard9o,mightyblues7,If you win the toss in India you win in three days. End of story.
4973MQard9o,Spateri,Drop Warner already. Smith to stay as captain.  Produce a good test pitch India. Not even 7 sessions. So bad for test cricket.

d_O3MjHFdiI,Dom James,"One thing that is being forgotten is how England bowled in Pakistan on the flattest of flat pitches, taking 20 wickets in every test. Stokes set some aggressive fields, which helped the cause of the bowlers."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Peter Barnett,So michael  is joining the ashes commentary. I hope they show a picture of him as Aussies mostly just remember him trudging off the pitch for piquant score

d_O3MjHFdiI,Mike Crowther,"&quot;...and then they (England) put New Zealand on the back foot, away from home...&quot; That&#39;s true. However, in the second test The Black Caps came from an almost impossible position (having been asked to follow on) to beat England in one of the most extraordinary victories in the history of the game."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Christian Oakley,"Is the Ashes on Fox Cricket? I know its on 9GEM,...but I have very poor reception,...so Foxtel is my go to TV."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Paul Kilby,"On bbc sport Michael Vaughan, Ashes-winning captain in 2005: &quot;History says Australia haven&#39;t won in the UK since 2001. The last time they were here in 2019, it was a very similar team to what they have now and they only managed a 2-2 draw against an England team that wasn&#39;t very good. England are miles better now and they will surprise the Australians.&quot;<br><br>Just changes his view for the audience."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Kevin Roark,England is not a balanced side and they are going to lose badly to the Aussies.
d_O3MjHFdiI,jimmy O'driscoll,The Aussies asking Vaughan who&#39;s going to win m.v says I think Australia could win. How dare you even say that. As an Englishman. Eng will win. do you think the Aussies would say oh England gonna win no &quot;F*** chance.
d_O3MjHFdiI,Iftikhar Ali,Michael Vaughan should be England coach
d_O3MjHFdiI,saturday player,English bowling fitness is the big gorilla in the room. Bazball will win them one test but if it remains dry and warm the bowlers will struggle- no spinner.
d_O3MjHFdiI,Matt Donovan,"If England keep everyone fit, and theres some cloud, itll be really close. My worry is by the 3rd test we could be 2 or 3 bowlers down. So much hangs on the first test. Whoever wins that probably wins the ashes."
d_O3MjHFdiI,dani rana,Aussies love rascist why do you keep inviting vaughan
d_O3MjHFdiI,dani rana,Big rascist Vaughan
d_O3MjHFdiI,Richard Martins,England wants the pitches to be flat playing right into Australia hands than swinging and lateral movements on a green pitch a huge mistake by the English management
d_O3MjHFdiI,Stuart Russell,Looking forward  to seeing Harry Brook 818 runs in first  7 tests. With all the talk of Smith England may just have one up their sleeve
d_O3MjHFdiI,Richard Martins,"Australia are battle hardened and their pace attack is quicker and lethal than the English full of dobblers and I&#39;ve seen the line up and they left out their quickest bowler mark wood from the first team,and a big mistake,leaving out Ben foakes a better wicketkeeper than bairstow and his form has been very good since JB has been injured and the shocking selection was bringing back moeen Ali from his retirement two years and where are the other spinners since leach 🧐🤔 I find it bad management and desperation,and lastly I see Australia winning 3-0 or 4-1"
d_O3MjHFdiI,Robert Symes,Australias bowling is good but there batting is suspect ...warner kawajha are definitely under pressure
d_O3MjHFdiI,vaibhav vyas,Always admire Michael Vaughan for his good analysis with few good one liners

d_O3MjHFdiI,Pavan Shetty,Moen Ali Has Done well in Test Matches In  England!! But What does It Mean to Don Bess &#39;s Test Carrier and The Bench Strength of Spinners In England!I think they should have  Tried Other Spinners!! Because They  Have  A Tough Tour Of India in Jan. 5 test Matches!!! Then  the they  have  test series in   Sri Lanka too !!! England should think of  Indian tour too. I understand This Ashes Series Tension Focus  Importance and All that!! But England has to keep  One  Eye On Indian Test series  as well!! Its All about Scoring Points for WTC!! And then no Point of thinking  once the Horse has Bolted!!what if  and Buts If they Loose in India Due to Lack Of Quality Spinners!!! With Jack Leach Having Stress  Fracture of the Back!!  Who knows  when will he come Back!! What About Surrey Spinner Amar Virdi? Why Not  Try  Young Leg Spinner Rehan Khan!! He  did well In Pakistan!!  He can Bat has well!! Australian as Hinstory  Dont Prefer Leg Break!!
d_O3MjHFdiI,hengus pod,crawley is a big worry
d_O3MjHFdiI,Sandeep Reddy,"My 11, 6+1+1+3, 1+1 is allrounder like Green"
d_O3MjHFdiI,Aka Miguel Sanchez,"Bowling isn’t a worry, few clouds and the Aussies arse’s will be flapping"
d_O3MjHFdiI,Truth Seeker,Is he still going on about Moheen Ali needing to check if other Muslims are terrorists? Has he asked other white people if they are rapists?
d_O3MjHFdiI,DAVID pvt,Anderson? Discuss please.<br>My heart says yes. My head says no.
d_O3MjHFdiI,AKAdeedeeDEE,Australia are the better team due to the bowling attack they will be able to field but they haven’t won a series over here in 20 years for a lot of reasons.<br>Australia need to exercise some very serious demons to win here
d_O3MjHFdiI,Mutant Family Gaming,"my prediction is moeen ali will be the worst choice on either team, we have younger and better bowlers and batters, I was hoping this foolishness had finished but obviously not.."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Bobanderand,this is definitely the best aussie lineup since the warne and mcgrath era so it’s definitely gonna be very tough for england. but we’ve kept doubting bazball every time a new challenge is put in front of it and it’s almost always delivered. honestly anything could happen. we could get smashed but playing as we are considering the form pre ben/baz definitely gives us the best chance of success
d_O3MjHFdiI,James L,"As an Englishman obviously I want to see us win. Bazball is tremendous entertainment and if they pummel the Aussie bowlers then we have a chance of winning. My biggest worry is how do we react if it doesn’t work? Only time will tell. One thing you can be sure of is that unless weather intervenes, there won’t be any draws! Heart says 4-1 England, head says 3-2 Australia."
d_O3MjHFdiI,bladerunner2049,"Really excited for the ashes this time around. <br>Will be interesting to see how well can the bazball approach work for england against this australian team. I believe if england can win or draw this series with that approach, more and more test teams around the world could be adapting to that style of playing."
d_O3MjHFdiI,James Crosby,"Going to be a close series but i think England will win 3-1. Home conditions will favor them and i feel Cummins trying to Captain and bowl over 5 tests will just fade away, his workload is way ro much."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Duncan Mackenzie,"Everyone keeps talking about the fact Australia hasn&#39;t once since 2001 but they retained the Ashes and should if won the series. They seem play the moving ball quite well these days, just look at the 1st day at the Oval last week. And then the Ashes on Australia had the most Engoish like conditions since 2011 when they won. But it was Australia who grinded out scores when it was tough and England&#39;s attack wilted.<br>I think that&#39;s the reason England d9nt want movement because they now are the bunnies on greentops."
d_O3MjHFdiI,All round,Only Root and Stokes will score consistently
d_O3MjHFdiI,Duncan Mackenzie,"England made 7 an over in the 1st test  on a road in Pakistan when all their bowlers had gone down. They fielded their most inexperienced attack since the 50&#39;s, Joe Root had more wickets than them collectively. Pakistan were also 50 runs from winning with 5 wickets in hand and only reverse swing from nowhere go aengland over the line."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Adam,"Vaughan is great as a commentator. Calls it as he sees it and is as unbiased as an ex-player can be. Obviously wants England to win, but always very fair with his comments."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Will Goodall,Depending on your outlook you could either say this England side are going in &#39;fresh&#39; or &#39;undercooked&#39;
d_O3MjHFdiI,Dave Carr,Michael Vaughan is a racist
d_O3MjHFdiI,Charlie McDonnell,Vaughan becoming a pundit in the one part of the cricketing world that he can show his face is hilarious
d_O3MjHFdiI,zeus star,Pope will ball
d_O3MjHFdiI,Duncan Mackenzie,"Noone talks about the reason Bazball has worked is down to their bowling. Having 5 matches squashed into 6 weeks is madness but not looking good for Englands predicament.<br>Stokes has only just started to bowl recently with his knee  heavily strapped. Robinson is still fat and coming of injury, Anderson too has been injured and 40, Broad 37, Wood is brittle and Moeen hasn&#39;t played tests for 2 years and was dropped both times he last played an Ashes series. If the latter doesn&#39;t hold up an end and Root has to bowl whcluch effects his stamina to bat their pace attack will be under the pump physically.<br>They have very few options for a spinner and some of their reserve pace bowlers are also injured."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Andy Hills,"Despite Australia being so successful recently, I can tell you being an England fan has been so much fun. Call me old but fun trumps winning."
d_O3MjHFdiI,stephen wright,&quot;It has worked.&quot; But.... it isn&#39;t their GAME. Worked for Sehwag ans Warner.
d_O3MjHFdiI,Abdul Qadir,4-1 England kangaroos don’t win in England so see ya
d_O3MjHFdiI,Honey,I think it is a bad call to not even keep foakes in the squad. As Pant is injured it is fare to say that currently world&#39;s best wicketkeeper is Ben Foakes and poms are doing the same mistake what India did by leaving out Ashwin. Bairstow is a good batsmen but in some days he horribly gets knocked over and now add onto the fact of his ultra aggressive character. Travis Head is there to counter that Jonny affect. The Aussies won&#39;t shy away from firing Ben and Jonny up because they do have Head and Warner + Starc to rip&#39;em apart.
d_O3MjHFdiI,Neil Birch,"Australia for me are too strong, their bowling attack is relentless.  Smith is a freak and will take some beating. I hope I&#39;m wrong."
d_O3MjHFdiI,JTalkin'Sport,What an insulting comment by Brendon Jullian to Ireland
d_O3MjHFdiI,Andrew Fearn,"3-1 England.<br><br>The batting line up is just too deep, from Duckett (in form) all the way down to Ali at 8 and even with the aggressive approach enough of the batsmen will get enough runs to be too competitive in home conditions."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Vinayak Deshmukh,What&#39;s the name of the host of the show??
d_O3MjHFdiI,Victor Renz,i wonder what he REALLY feels about Moeen Ali joining the ashes 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
d_O3MjHFdiI,Mr p,No one wants listen to this racist
d_O3MjHFdiI,Adam,Fair play to MV there... There were too many Aussies on the panel &amp; he did not do anything about it.
d_O3MjHFdiI,imran lion,Bazzball will destroy Aussie maybe 4-0 to England this time
d_O3MjHFdiI,Dave B,"In that second innings India demonstrated that Bazball can most certainly work against this Aussie bowling attack. And they were playing am amateur version of it<br><br>And Cummings is a fairly clueless captain who may, and probably will, crumble in the face of the English onslaught <br><br>Bring it on. Let&#39;s consign 2005 to the runners up step of the greatest Ashes series podium"
d_O3MjHFdiI,Hadrian,2-2 going into the Oval.
d_O3MjHFdiI,Jackson Berry,Talk about deluded Australia 3-1
d_O3MjHFdiI,Paul Mason,England fan here. Think Aus will win. It’s gonna be close ish but I reckon 3-2 or 4-1 Aus.
d_O3MjHFdiI,Dr suliman Khan,Eng win 4 to 1
d_O3MjHFdiI,Rakesh Chitalay,pl do not doubt Bazball .in fact it will be worth watching aussie bowlers getting hammered to 400-450 runs in 80-85 overs on day 1 of series.  Then it will be intresting to see how starc and hazelwood can last five tests???
d_O3MjHFdiI,wasim syed,Aus will win 3-1
d_O3MjHFdiI,Thinlay Bhutia,"England to win 3:2,Smithy highest run getter and Robinson highest wicket taker."
d_O3MjHFdiI,Edwin Thol,“There’s too many of you lot; we have to have a word about that”
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Weic Lur,"Brilliant, great to see Vaughanie back"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Recb Bsim,Robinson had the best match bowling figures on both sides in the 1st test.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Mondo P,I see eng winning at lords sadly
jBf7Ly_NxTE,james keays,Hope Vaughny comes out to Aus this summer. Genuinely enjoy his commentary
jBf7Ly_NxTE,james keays,That bucket hat on that bucket head
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Steven Levitzke,Anyone else notice how much England (men and women) teams just LOVE to lose. But but but we were entertaining!!!! 😂😂
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Kevin Pillay,You get the feeling that this attacking bazball style will allow England to get away with losing as everyone is like so excited with losing an ashes test match.  You haev to win test matches no matter.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Kim Lowe,"It’s great when England “feel like it was a win”. I think they should do it again. Feelings are good and need to be encouraged. It’s good for morale, don’t you think? Yep! England needs to keep feeling!"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Nick Harris,Vaughan is good value really. And always endeared to Australians when he played so brilliantly on that disastrous 02/03 tour.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,The Hanging Torch of Darkness ,Why are Aussies always butt hurt lol do they teach it in school down there
jBf7Ly_NxTE,George Jones,"Dominated the test match lol - Vaughan must have missed most of the match, maybe he was out the back having a drink."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,The Real Darkstar,"I&#39;d love to hear Geoff Boycott&#39;s view on bazball, I think it would be worth a listen."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Ian Hall,Apparently england are gonna win by 150 runs
jBf7Ly_NxTE,woopimagpie,"All the bluster and talking by England is a risky strategy - if they don&#39;t win they&#39;ll be a top class laughing stock.<br>England looked pretty close to their limit of ability in that first test, whereas Australia played well within themselves and still won comfortably in the end. Smith and Labuschagne basically did nothing, and Warner still has points to prove. If any of those three dig in it&#39;s all over. Warner especially is the dark horse, he&#39;s in the twilight of his career and not playing that well, England need to be careful not to underestimate him, he&#39;ll take the game away if they give him any room. The other factor is Starc - if it&#39;s overcast and he gets the radar on target he is lethal. He can move the ball around just as much as the England bowlers at a faster pace, he&#39;s ultra dangerous if he gets it right.<br>England have a lot of pressure on them, Australia not so much. We&#39;re yet to see Australia play their best game - if they really fire on all cylinders England have no chance."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Mucho Macho,Dominated the whole game except the the last day? Delusional!
jBf7Ly_NxTE,AC92,Robinson had the best match bowling figures on both sides in the 1st test.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Phil Robinson,"As a Pom Vaughny was wrong, Until the Cummins - Lyon partnership the test swung to and fro, It wasn&#39;t the early declaration that cost England for me when Cameron Green was on 0 Bairstow missed a stumping Green went on to score 31, Those runs made a difference, For the 2nd Test Ollie Robinson (no relation) should zip it &amp; let the ball do the talking, As i&#39;m writing this Mark Wood has been overlooked &amp; Josh Tongue of Worcestershire has been brought in so it will be an all pace attack, I&#39;m hoping England hit back but also expecting a response from Smith &amp; Labuschagne who missed out at Birmingham...Keep The Faith"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Vasanth Manivannan,Nothing about the girls who played a exceptional game.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Diptesh Mitkar,Fool.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Josh J,Anderson gotta go for me he offers nothing
jBf7Ly_NxTE,TheGreeny38 Wolves,England lost that game with dropped chances and making stupid decisions against a very good side. Play entertaining cricket but have some brains. Also if the ball does move around I think Australia can make it go as well.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Keith Kaos,England played well in all sessions and Smith and Labuschagne didn’t really get a score and yet we still lost.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,The Fun Police,I suspect Khawaja and Lyon might have something to say about England dominating over all of the first four days.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,David Rees,"44,.,,on 🎉🎉🎉, 😢,😢🎉🎉.🎉🎉🎉"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,AndyP,"Yeah I believe the match was lost due to our poor show in the field and that has to come down to preparation. Was it arrogance or just over confidence, I don&#39;t know but the Aussies had a tough competitive match against India in the build up while we kicked back taking it easy. If we are playing this certain brand of cricket why not play Bairsrow as an opener and bring Foakes back in to keep. Catches win matches and if he had taken those opportunities behind the stumps we would have won. You can&#39;t afford to be rusty in an ashes series and Crawley&#39;s averages are not good enough."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,CRICKET WORLD CUP,this england will be given a message so that they will never ever open the mouth against any team ever again.. jokers sayjng some bazball and getting hit in their balls
jBf7Ly_NxTE,David Law,Let&#39;s skip a head a week from today and the Aussies are up 2-0. Will the talking heads and Captain Punchable still say we &quot; don&#39;t care if we lose we came to entertain &quot; ?
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Clive Clive,"Embarrassing chat at times, anyone would have thought England lost by an innings, on a horrendous run and nobody wants to watch them!!"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,T C,"I agree re warner he needs to wind back the clock his last ashes just hit the ball, hooks pulls drives and smash the leather off the ball. Hes to tentitive in his old age"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,suze Martin,I wish this Australia team to smash this over confident england..
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Gorge Smiff,Convicts will lose at Lord&#39;s
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Quincycle,Blowing so much smoke it&#39;s ridiculous
jBf7Ly_NxTE,owen davies,"England supporters can say England shouldn&#39;t of declared in the 1st innings, but Australia probably fielded completely the opposite to what they did in the ICC World Test match series Vs India as well. The result was the <a href=""http://result.it/"">result.It</a> seriously could of gone either way though tbh both sides should be better in the 2nd Test."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,paul herbert,England better side for most of test match difference Aussies had a good spin bowler poms had part timers to me that was the difference.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,thornwivans,Well the didnt pick Wood...they picked Josh Tongue instead of Mo Ali
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Sharath Kumar,"As a neutral cricket fan, let me tell where England failed, England can’t bat out Australia, there is no chance in hell that English batters be better batters than Aussie batters. England need to bring in their strength which is wonderful swing bowling <br>Else England will lose this ashes in England after 22 years"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Neil MURPHY,"Why give an interview to the Aussies and be such a wet wipe? Give me the current England side giving a bit of mouth over pundits like Vaughan who basically kiss Australian arse. The test was in the balance right until the end, and he goes on eulogising about the opposition like it was an innings defeat. Pathetic."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,nitin belvi,Imagine if Archer and Wood were available. <br>Come on England bazzball is the future. The whole world looks forward to your batting.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,George Rutherford,"Brilliant, great to see Vaughanie back😁"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,marcus chalkley,Another geezer bird
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Jav,"I do like this England team but much the same as the football team, the fans and media are unbearable for the most part"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Karl Taylor,Good interview. Always liked Vaughany. Smart cricketer.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,H3X Group,England didn’t deserve to win it. Too many mistakes but scary to think how they’d go on a traditional England pitch. Talking it up usually backfires so the Poms are taking a risk.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Fightlads .net,"The weather for the Lord&#39;s Test looks like it&#39;ll be cloudy and possibly some rain will be seen. Certainly not hot and dry as was the case for most of the last Test. That should bring in the likes of Anderson and Robinson more than it did in the last match. The England seamers need either a green top or overhead conditions to get 20 wickets at a reasonable cost. But those conditions will also blunt our batsmen&#39;s attacking approach, as if the ball is moving around it&#39;s harder to play their new brand of attacking batting. The first Test was 50/50 for most of the play with Australia just getting ahead on that last session - and fair play to them for winning the match. Test Cricket itself was probably the main winner from that last match. 5 days of VERY exciting cricket. I know that the main 2 Australian batsmen did not do that well, and that they are almost certain to pile in with some runs at Lord&#39;s. But I do think the teams are quite even in most areas. Australia do have Lyon and he is world class. Sadly, since Swann we&#39;ve simply not had a decent spinner and that may cost us dearly in this series. I still think England may edge the series 3 - 2 as I cannot see there being any matches drawn. Unless we get some really bad weather. England move the game on so fast these days that it almost takes poor weather out of the equation. I&#39;d love to see Pope get more runs as he has the class. Root is certain to get runs, and if both Stokes and Bairstow also pile up the runs then that can balance the scales for Smith and Marnus. Whatever the outcome I think the series will be something that&#39;ll entertain us....."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Cosmic Goat,Australia was always in the touching distance through out 5 days.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,MondoTV,"Selecting Moeen Ali is the antithesis of Bazball. He was never a specialist bowler, he was always a bowling all rounder. He&#39;s there to strengthen the batting but the truth is he adds little to the bowling. It&#39;s a defensive, rather than an attacking move. Come on Baz - explain that selection to the masses. And picking Bairstow as keeper - also just designed to strengthen the batting. Defensive to the extreme."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Hilal Ahmad,Micheal vaughan australia is not easy team
jBf7Ly_NxTE,GB Marso,"Cocky poms,  bring it on"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Sir Ank,"As an England fan the biggest concern was how Jimmy looked, he’s been injured the past month and he looked very rusty, hopefully it was just an aberration and he can be back to his best."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,colddiesel,"If it is cloudy at Lords Boland is a must. I would however, still prefer Starc to Hazelwood. England has to play a proper WK. Bairstow missed too many chances. Bairstow as batsman only."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Paul Newman,2-0 coming up 👍
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Jazzanaught,Aussies will win 5-0 and all we’ll hear is about how good England are for the game bla bla bla
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Eulogist,Dominated the whole match?! They’re delusional
jBf7Ly_NxTE,jack tattis,Watch out for the Poms
jBf7Ly_NxTE,doug harrison,Considering Smith and Labuschange did nothing with the bat theres still a lot of upside for Australia.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,QuicknStraight,Need to stick with Scotty Boland at Lord&#39;s. His accuracy and the slope will cause England a heap of problems. And i can&#39;t wait to see a spinner bowl a &#39;cannonball&#39;!
jBf7Ly_NxTE,widescreentv,"I think a lot of people are underestimating how poor australia were with their bowling on the first day, not to mention there fielding looked pretty lackadaisical<br>I also think they will play this Bazball a bit better and have slightly more attacking fielding positions to stop the easy singles in they gave up on that first day"
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Ross Menzies,England chatter is Small Man&#39;s Syndrome.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Europa 1,Love listening to Vaughan gutted he got banished from UK tv for unproven allegations.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,ashleckie,Also consider England needed their best players to stand up whereas our best players in Marnus and Smith failed with the bat...more upside with the Aussies..plus a fired up Starc will return
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Craig Pilgrim,"England are compromised with dual goals and strategies.1.Entertain the public to maintain test match viability in light of T20 cricket (M.C.C. administrators want to maintain their supremacy in world cricket administration, I believe), and <a href=""http://2.win/"">2.Win</a> the match-even though traditionally, England firstly went about not losing, THEN going for the win. Dual strategies, tend to lead to lost focus, duelling motivations, especially one of the goals being a &quot;Bazball , new era&quot; for England cricket ( i.e going for the win, before first ensuring they don&#39;t lose)."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Laurence Tilley,"Vaughany, you sound like a real pain-in-the-arse Pommy cricket commentator. &#39;pretty much dominated the test match until the last hour&#39;&#39;, hahahahaha, Only in your dreams mate. Instead of going to the commentary box mate, you should apply to join the &#39;Barmy Army&#39;. The Aussies proved convincingly why they are the World test champs with an 89 run win."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,odelayrowe monkey,why are you doing all this if you&#39;re not actually streaming the games??
jBf7Ly_NxTE,ajayvs1,So if we are going with the logic that most wickets in tests as a metric to call Anderson the best English bowler. Then would Board be the second best English bowler ever!?
jBf7Ly_NxTE,cramthelan,"Of course the early declaration wasn&#39;t the issue, it&#39;s such a red herring. England needed 20 wickets and they didn&#39;t manage it with the extra time the early declaration allowed. With a later declaration they were even less likely to mange it if everything stayed the same. True they likely could have stopped the loss and guaranteed a draw if they batted on, but it definitely doesn&#39;t guarantee a win and they certainly aren&#39;t the first to play attacking test cricket and utilising &quot;sporting&quot; declarations."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,B D,"Always liked Vaughny as a Pom, well spoken and provides reasoned analysis."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Steven Skliros,England dominated? That&#39;s not how i see it - 1st innings England 5-176 Australia 5-311 <br>2nd innings England 5-150.<br>The wicket at Lord&#39;s will be like at Edgbaston doctored to England&#39;s liking
jBf7Ly_NxTE,David Davies,Vaughan too clever to drink the bazball cool aid. One of the best commentators.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Normah Fadzil,If bazball continues on a greener wicket….england will go down 2-0 within 4 days play😊
jBf7Ly_NxTE,The Last Ninja,"England are in total denial about what happened in the first Test. Even Winviz, whatever that thing is, was showing for most of the test it was even Steven, until the Aussie pair showed true grit on the final day to capture the win. The English played at home with a style they wanted to play and on a pitch that suited them and still couldn’t get the win! I call that a total failure, nothing else. Also, English commentators state that the Australian way of playing is ‘one dimensional’ it’s an absurd statement because what type of cricket is England playing “Bazball”, a blast ‘em out of the ground brand of cricket, hit ‘em hard and far mentally, that to me is one dimensional cricket right there! Joe Root being stumped for the first time in Test cricket in the second innings for England is a great example of what I see in their game."
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Ian Kearns,Dominated the Test Match until the last hour and lost? LMAO
jBf7Ly_NxTE,A Abhishek,Why would you want starc on the flatter pitch ? From what I have seen with starc he needs the pitch and swing through the air otherwise he is just fodder .
jBf7Ly_NxTE,JTP,People only care about who won lmao
jBf7Ly_NxTE,MachineThatCreates,Imagine how painful it would&#39;ve been if England won.
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Peter Emery,I&#39;ve been very amused by the English commentators saying that their side was ahead for the majority of the test only to lose it on the last day. In my opinion the Aussies were on par for most of the test and started to edge ahead on day 4 and then took it away on the final day!
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Tuhid Khan,I think Australia did not play their cricket despite that they won the game..Bazball is good but when you have &quot;never give up&quot; attitude no one can defeat you...Hatts off Pat Cummins..<br>People often talk about pat defensive captaincy in the first but he was pragmatic
jBf7Ly_NxTE,Rob Davis,&quot;England dominated until that last hour&quot;.....hmmm I think I must have been watching a different match.
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Dark Gathering WFB,Starc can be a game changer ... with so many strong bowlers &amp; backup Bowlers= it gonna be a hard choice
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Strange Name For A Band,"It sounds to me like the panel is admitting that England are doctoring pitches. You would never hear this a couple of years ago, heard Harsha Bhogle say this a couple of weeks ago about India. Huge story nobody&#39;s running with."
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Sharan Chugh,"Bazball is an exceptional style of playing, the only way one can save Test Cricket! If not we are going to see only the big 3 playing test cricket in the years to come!"
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Biswadip Sasaru,Think Starc should replace Hazlewood!
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Trevor Crook,Indigenous ? She looks Swedish
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Anthony Grace,Gardner would get a game for the english hehe
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Trevor Crook,Women’s cricket is poor
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Shiraz,No the women should be playing at least 3 tests. Having a couple of hit and giggle 20/20s in the mix is a poor decision.
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Matthew Pittard,So why has CA scheduled the return Ashes and subsequents test for.. 4 days? What the hell is going on?
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Shire Smokers BBQ,Hey Boys. Is she not there?
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Pas Triulcio,Ollie robinson sleeps with the light on
Eo_LU0UXMbI,James C,Honestly I’d love to see a system where the women’s ashes games are played in between the men’s. Not sure if the calendar will allow for it but if it’s possible that would be great. Nonstop ashes test cricket for 8-10 weeks would be sensational.
Eo_LU0UXMbI,lobwah kk,cant drop Boland. Hazelwood out/ Starc in
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Jimmy Riddle,Indigenous? Give me a spell
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Murray McLean,I used to love the back page..when it was a sports show..you with Mick Gibson and Billy Birmingham..not this woke bullshit served with a side of disinformation. 😢
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Michael Lincoln,"The Bazball approach to cricket whilst it is spectacular, it can be a stupid approach sometimes. For example, if England had been smarter, the series score would be 0-0. The idea is to win the series not wholly entertain. The younger generation want instant gratification in sport. But real entertainment is the art of warriorship in the grinding down of the opposition. Entertainment in sport is an add-on not the aim. Test cricket should be 2 teams using every trick in the book to win a series. In the first test England could have got a draw. Now they&#39;re 0-1 down. Bazball style should only be used on rare occasions such as the last test of an even series. If you want instant gratification take up cyber games."
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Dr.Ritesh Chhabra,Bring full conversation !
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Matthew Michaels,"If Starc returns, he&#39;s got be 145 kph+ regularly to make a difference because he&#39;s not the metronome Boland is."
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Dominic Smith,Would love to know how many hours of the women’s test these guys watched…. What a piss take
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Nightwatchman,"Bazball is bigger than the ashes. Eng and aus are the only countries that celebrate test cricket, but attracting the young demographic matters too, or otherwise we won&#39;t have test cricket in a couple of decades. No one remembers 2009, 2013 and 2015 ashes cos the brand of cricket played was dour. What&#39;s the value of those victories then? Go bazball!"
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Zs,Underneath grass it would be flat 😂😂😂😂
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Rajah Hindi,Craddock needs help
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Scott Wilson,"Wtf do you mean it&#39;s not enough? If you&#39;re good enough to play, you get picked. Ffs there&#39;s not enough Asian Australian players represented...it&#39;s just not enough!!!"
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Nightwatchman,While we&#39;re at it why not send our U16s for their own ashes series too? Surely the boys will match the standard of ladies cricket
Eo_LU0UXMbI,Mohammad Umair,Mitchell starc available is second test

eCyvX68xdCQ,Antony Steel,And they complain about whinging poms!
eCyvX68xdCQ,Antony Steel,Nope.  When you show appalling sportsmanship you deserve everything you get
eCyvX68xdCQ,Rod Hamilton,Whinging Aussies 😢
eCyvX68xdCQ,Angie Sumner,Sounds like she&#39;s a lot of guessing to me. Thought us poms were supposed to be the whingers. Of course your fans are so lovely to the England players when were over there
eCyvX68xdCQ,BonJovi71,Oh my god but these women bring want to turn this into a soapie.
eCyvX68xdCQ,The Truth,"Same as their football fans, England&#39;s cricket fans are absolutely feral."
eCyvX68xdCQ,JUMBO,Just visited the UK for the first time in 30 years......could not believe how much the country has gone down hill in this time. Cultural standards and behaviour have disintergrated and the place is now nothing more than a shithole!!
eCyvX68xdCQ,graham higgs,"I’m an England fan now living in Australia , and was enjoying watching the Ashes , but the insults flying both ways have turned me off it. The run-out controversy , which wasn’t, an experienced cricketer walking up the pitch and and the keeper knocking the wicket over. Umpire gave him out , so that’s it. The sight of privileged drunk old men abusing players , face to face was pretty ugly, as was retired players and stupid TV personalities  accusing Australia of cheating. The predictable backlash of ‘ whinging Poms ‘ followed and some fairly nasty Australian comments , as though the entire population was in on the accusations . I’m done with it, players can play as hard as they like, but the media agitating all this crap has done it for me. Leave it on the playing field."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Jacob Jones,Considering Australians always call us poms whiners this is very ironic 😂
eCyvX68xdCQ,Sebastian 91,Yes because the Aussie fans never did any of the sort whenever England would go to Australia….. 😂
eCyvX68xdCQ,junk_rig_sailor,"Aussie sandpaper players cried on camera like little girls whose mum wouldn&#39;t buy them a barbie doll. Pack of whimps.  Also, you want to talk about abusive crowds? Just ask any New Zealander Cricketer that has toured Australia, what the Ocker crowds are like...especially if you are a great player  - ask Richard Hadlee about the abuse he got on his many tours of Australia just because he so was so damn good."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Richard Belben,"Never heard such rubbish , poor pussies they sure don’t like it back"
eCyvX68xdCQ,Stephen Mlangeni,"Australians are full of shi*, they always back their own but some of us remember &quot;sandpaper gate&quot; and how they backed Smith when we booed him in SA"
eCyvX68xdCQ,Kosmullage Kumara,"Oi Mate, don&#39;t cry."
eCyvX68xdCQ,joneff,"Candice lobbying for hubby, as a future Fox  Cricket panelist, post retirement maybe?"
eCyvX68xdCQ,Aussie Shane,I was at Egbaston. No chance l would take my kids.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Derek Franks,The way Aussie supporters treat English players on a daily basis especially in Sydney you have to be joking. I would have thought the MCC members would have been more restrained but for Australians to seek the moral high ground in the treatment of visiting players you must be joking.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Allison Hughes,"See you in Oz next time Poms. You’re going to love it, trust us"
eCyvX68xdCQ,Jacob Kuntflapp,Get the females off the panel.
eCyvX68xdCQ,muhammad haroon,Civilized dogs going bonkers.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Indoscot,The Aussie lady complaining about the amount of alcohol consumed at a Test Match at Lords. Jesus wept. Clearly she has never watched the Aussies at home
eCyvX68xdCQ,samsiddh,Well the difference was that this European league thing happened mid over and not at the end of it.. makes a hell of a difference
eCyvX68xdCQ,Benjamin Grange,What the hell is she doing on any show?!!!
eCyvX68xdCQ,Dominic Charters,"This is utterly hilarious, I don’t know where to start?!<br><br>Is she the one who was farming herself out to cop for a sports pro? In the toilets with the giant rugby hunk and ended up with ratface Warner?<br><br>Has she kept the rugby lad’s jacket and worn it to that studio?!<br><br>The self-victimisation and moral grandstanding from a country with an infinitely better outdoor and sporting cultures with equally better climate is staggering. <br><br>They’re clearly rattled, lovely to see."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Max,Christ you lot have gone soft
eCyvX68xdCQ,James Campbell,i know Fox isn&#39;t exactly neutral but having Davie&#39;s wife dicussing the issue is purely hilarious
eCyvX68xdCQ,Roy Munson,Warners bird is prime Aussie cricket commentator 😂😂
eCyvX68xdCQ,OA,Mrs David Warner moaning about morality! I have seen it all!!
eCyvX68xdCQ,Jack87,Aussies have short memories. You got caught cheating a few years ago. Wind your necks in
eCyvX68xdCQ,Silvio Dante,God i love Aussies they are so well balanced people. Chips on both their shoulders.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Josh Ferier,"At the end of the day bairstow was out clear cut. The english made a big deal about it because they are sore losers, which there is nothing worse in my opinion for a professional sporting team."
eCyvX68xdCQ,David Ashworth,"What a load of rubbish these guys speak. Comparing Bairstow&#39;s dismissal with the one they show towards the end of the segment is ridiculous. Not even close to being the same. bairstow was in his crease to receive the ball, and you can see him do almost a toe tap in the crease before walking out. The other batter didn&#39;t even start in his crease and never made it back to the crease. Typical Australian viewpoint of trying to justify what was an appalling smack in the face of the spirit of the game. Shame on Carey, but even more shame on these presenters trying to justify."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Syed Skywalker,I don&#39;t think australian crowds abuse english players this much when they visit Australia
eCyvX68xdCQ,Khan Jee,Haha. Aussies have always been Bullies and everyone knows it. Getting a little taste of their own medicine &amp; have now started crying already. What a joke.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Prabhu Mech,Come on guys .y cheat and then cry
eCyvX68xdCQ,Love Nothate,I&#39;m English born and lived in Australia since 1970..<br>I&#39;ve never changed my national identity but am now.<br>I don&#39;t tell anyone I&#39;m English born because of the whining pom jokes hahaha.<br>It&#39;s been really poor from the English to abuse the world champions for being cheats as they have.<br>It&#39;s fair to say Australia cheated back in the day because they did..<br>But so have England and many times at that so very hypocritical from my EX countrymen and just shows the nature of the whining English...
eCyvX68xdCQ,Thewayne FlyingHigh!,If people want to boo they should be allowed to do so.
eCyvX68xdCQ,kipps guitar,"Whatever happened to wokey Australia, so PC with bloody women analysts, a once great country gone woke, the great Richie benaud will be turning in his grave, oh dear oh dear, RIP ashes cricket, the once greatest sporting show on earth"
eCyvX68xdCQ,Lemarc,Sad to see the Aussies getting soft. Actually it’s just Candice winging. How many games of cricket has she played?
eCyvX68xdCQ,Jonathan Gregory,"“Cricket fans boo the opposition. Players have words. Opposition don’t turn up to lunch. Cricket fans drink alcohol! Bowler gives batsman sweary send off!” HOLD THE FRONT PAGE 😂! Most of those things happen when England tour Down Under. The only things that cross the line are fans kicking players &amp; if the abuse was racial. If so, then I condemn that. Otherwise it seems as if the Australians don’t like it when England &amp; English fans behave like Australians."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Church of the Assumption Cricket Club,Opposed to Australians fans you throw beer cans at injured players (Simon Jones)
eCyvX68xdCQ,Krikey its time for cricket,"Just wondering, with this happening to a ‘white’ team, what teams of other colour have had to go through in these stadiums in the past."
eCyvX68xdCQ,London Lad,Hypocrisy much?
eCyvX68xdCQ,Craig Van Asche,Didn’t she cheat on him with Sonny Bill? And she calls us disgusting?
eCyvX68xdCQ,Louquay,The answer is no
eCyvX68xdCQ,Phani DOKKU,"Yeah  typical Australian cricketers they do what they want for just to win (not always in fair manner like sand paper,aluminum bat, under arm bowling ,squash ball, graphite bats, mongoose bats ,mind fade etc etc  )and media will follows and supports it"
eCyvX68xdCQ,David Gayford,SBW says hi
eCyvX68xdCQ,David Ellery,why are we giving Candice a platform?  hardly objective or the morale compass based on her past
eCyvX68xdCQ,Nick Atkinson,"The crowd reflect the reailty of life in the UK at the moment, Inflation, Government unpopular, the farming sector is a mess post brexit, everyday costs skyrocketing and  frequent strikes from the railway, teaching and nursing staff. So along comes the Ashes and maybe it can finaly be good news! Nope Aussies 2  nil up."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Frozenbabypanda,Strange how neutral umpires gave Bairstow out. In line with the laws of cricket.<br>The fact that Bairstow has said very little indicates he knew he was asleep &amp; would&#39;ve done the same thing.<br>The MCC should be more upset about who thought red &amp; yellow were great club colours.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Jamie Heslop,"Stick to the Tik Tok dances Candice. If you&#39;re gonna take the moral highroad approach you deserve the criticism you are going to receive, Australian crowds are up there with the worst of them for lewd behavior and abuse. Also, nothing screams &#39;grubby&#39; like a corporate box, free food and free booze, I hope you got your fill."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Bhupi Bam,Smith❤❤❤
eCyvX68xdCQ,Rashed,English people need to be more civilised..
eCyvX68xdCQ,The Eudaimonia Project ,Oh because Australian crowds are known for not booing... And David Warner would be expert on what is in the spirit of cricket 😅
eCyvX68xdCQ,The Truth,He&#39;s a nice guy and all but Uzzie can be a bit of a sook sometimes. Nothing wrong with a bit of banter and to be fair the Aussie&#39;s deserve most of it due to past indiscretions
eCyvX68xdCQ,Salvador Gonzalez,Stop ya whinging. As an Aussie we cop it. Lets the Poms have the whinging. Harden the f up. Seriously.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Simon Jess,"You are allowed one 750ml bottle. You would have thought you could at least get that right. In any event, it is irrelevant as in Aus and Lords you can buy as much as you want in the ground. It talks to cost rather than a reason for inebriation."
eCyvX68xdCQ,Ozzy Laurtoria,Lighten up.
eCyvX68xdCQ,James Hunt,Is she David Warners wife?
eCyvX68xdCQ,Trevor Evans,To be honest it was shocking. Very disappointed that we stumped a batsman in that manner but also that Khawaja was spoken to in an inappropriate and disrespectful manner on his dismissal. Both disgusting and regrettable.
eCyvX68xdCQ,Charles W,"If someone had told me that viewers were going to get a lesson on grace and decorum from the wife of David Warner?!? I wouldn’t have believed them.<br><br>This is really jumping the shark of delusional hypocrisy, no matter what you think of the stumping, and what team you support."
eCyvX68xdCQ,sdqazx,The aussies deserve it
eCyvX68xdCQ,Codie,It’s embarrassing if we’re trying to take the moral high ground
eCyvX68xdCQ,Subodh Ghimire,Wow table has really turned. Like Australian crowd behave properly 😂😂😂

A0wLx721tDs,Ajay Mani Raj,Did Kwa just slap England on their face 😅
A0wLx721tDs,Roshan Rajurkar,"India, Australia and England are certain semifinalists. One of Pakistan or New Zealand will join them. South Africa will be dark horses. Srilanka can cause some major upsets. No chance for Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Netherlands."
A0wLx721tDs,Akshay mate,"Things India needs to address:<br>1. Suryakumar needs to bat aggressively and disrupt the opponent&#39;s field. He&#39;s a batsman who cannot play an innings of more than 30-60 balls. He can either score 50 runs or 100 runs in those balls, doesn&#39;t make sense shackling him to play restrictively.<br>2. The tail enders need to be able to rotate strike.<br>3. Batsman need to get aggressive when wickets are in hand and fewer overs are left rather than prioritising their individual scores.<br>4. If Pandya can bowl 10 overs, and India can play an extra batsman instead of Shami/Shardul. Solve the Pandya replacement crisis incase he gets injured or isn&#39;t able to play.<br>5. Wicketkeeping needs to be on point."
A0wLx721tDs,Kashif Altaf,Just lazy on Uzzie&#39;s part thinking Windies are in this world cup. Hopefully he will do better when he&#39;s commentating full time.
A0wLx721tDs,Prasoon Raj,West Indies aren&#39;t even in the World Cup

oELP_e8Z3Ro,prashantkumar137,"World Cup Indo-Pak combined XI-<br><br>Sachin, Sehwag, Kohli, Miandad, Yuvraj, Dhoni (wk), Imran (c), Kapil, Wasim, Jadeja, Saqlain.<br><br>Not included Waqar as his world cup record is not great."
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Parvez Hussain,Same 11 except Kapil out and in comes Sultan of Swing. Rohit could replace Sehwag.
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Ali Saif,"I would switch Saeed Anwar with Rohit Sharma, Kapil Dev with Saeed Ajmal and Jasprit Bumrah with Wasim Akram. Even a combination of prime Australia and prime West Indies is not touching this team"
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Amit Dhar,So humble that he didnt pick himself. Anyone from the subcontinent or outside will select him blindly for ODIs.
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Taheem Hussein,he missed a player who suffered from leg issues from childhood and still made history as one of the dangerous fastest bowler ever cricket had! 😪
oELP_e8Z3Ro,ahmar anwar,"Bumrah? I mean Shoaib Akhtar, Zaheer Khan?"
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Sadie SINK,No all time ind odi team is possible without yuvi and zaheer...you can&#39;t just pick people just on the basis of number and records..but you have to pick men on the basis of match winning abilities
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Asim Yousuf,Ponting&#39;s Australia would batter any Asian 11 with a hand tied behind their back.
oELP_e8Z3Ro,LEELA KUMAR KAKINADA,"I pick <br>1.Rohit Sharma<br>2.Sachin Tendulkar<br>3.Virat Kohli<br>4.Babar Azam<br>5.Shahid Afridi<br><a href=""http://6.ms/"">6.MS</a>. Dhoni<br>7.Imran khan<br>8.Kapil Dev<br>9.Kumble/Ajmal<br>10.Shoib Akhtar/ Shaheen shah Afridi<br>11.Bumrah"

oELP_e8Z3Ro,a2dsouza,"That&#39;s a hell of a team. I might pick Ravindra Jadeja ahead of Kapil Dev to have a second spin option that turns it the other way from Saqlain, not to mention his fielding, and I&#39;d put Wasim himself in place of Bumrah. And maybe Zaheer Abbas or Rohit Sharma instead of Virender Sehwag. But, every option is unbeatable."
oELP_e8Z3Ro,GAVISH JAISWAL,"It was a difficult task to  form a Indo -Pak team, but Wasim did a commendable job . I believe inclusion of a leg spinner would have made this team even more lethal."
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Avinash Tiwari,My indo pak XI is (current Players)<br>1 Mohammad Rizwan<br>2 Shubhman Gill <br>3 Virat Kohli<br>4 Babar Azam<br>5 KL Rahul<br>6 Ravindra Jadeja <br>7 Hardik Pandya<br>8 Kuldeep Yadav<br>9 Harris Rauf <br>10 Naseem Shah <br>11 Shahin Shah Afridi

oELP_e8Z3Ro,Ronit Sahoo,Cant go without picking rohit and yuvraj
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Saurabh Srivastava,#1. Nobody beats this team.<br>#2. Wasim Akram needs to be there.<br>#3. Only 2 constant in all-time Indo-Pak LOI XI. Akram &amp; Kapil. Everybody else can be replaced by a good player.
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Manish Singh,Wasim akram &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Quick Style,Wasim instead of Bumrah. Babar?
oELP_e8Z3Ro,TENCENT GAMES,NO INZI😥😣
oELP_e8Z3Ro,jazzweather,I would put Yuvraj Singh or Ganguly instead of Javed Miandad and replace Bumrah with Wasim Akram. Unbeatable.
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Kunwar Nagra,Wasim akram 🔥🔥
oELP_e8Z3Ro,jazzweather,My playing XI anytime - will always have a place for the great Wasim Akram!

oELP_e8Z3Ro,uday prakash,Can&#39;t pick Wasim.....because he will ibe playing for the all time  world 11
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Being Maanav,"He is not just a bowler, he is intelligent bowler on his time that&#39;s why he is, what he is today."
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Abhishek Singh,Bowling me Pakistan ke bowler aur chahiye the<br>Wasim akram kaise nahi hoga bhai
oELP_e8Z3Ro,hamza azmat,bumrah ? Really 🤣 where is Asif ? Shoaib ?
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Vivek Singh,"Close to perfect, only correction Inzmam in place of Javed at number 4"

oELP_e8Z3Ro,Saikat chakraborty,Common! You need to be on that list
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Vinay Tripathi,No offence to any of the greats here but between Imran and Dhoni you need to play only one of them as WASIM AKRAM is an absolute INDISPENSABLE in any team across eras and across format
oELP_e8Z3Ro,S.A.A.B. Life,What kind of rubbish subcontinental 11  is this without Wasim Akram??? Stupid selection.😂
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Niraj Pavagadhi,Imran khan captain 😂😂😂 what a joke

oELP_e8Z3Ro,Dhanraj Tolar  ✅,MS DHONI IS CAPTAIN NOT IMRAN KHAN. MS DHONI IS GREATEST CAPTAIN. WASIM U ARE WRONG.
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Rahul Ranjan,I will not take Jasprit Bumbrah only because I will take Wasim Akram
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Ayush Lamba,"My 11 will be,<br>Sachin Tendulkar <br>Saeed Anwar <br>Virat Kohli<br>Javed Miandad <br>Yuvraj Singh <br>MS Dhoni (wk)(C)<br>Kapil Dev<br>Wasim Akram <br>Waqar Younis<br>Jasprit Bumrah <br>Saqlain Mushtaq"

oELP_e8Z3Ro,Ministry of Alcohol,No ones beating this team be it great west indies or oz at prime
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Dhoni7,"He kept picking up his players. Anwar was pretty average when you compare even Ganguly, Sachin or even Rohit Sharma as opener. He could have taken Kohli at 3 and Yousuf or even Misbah or even Miadad."
oELP_e8Z3Ro,TRAKIN TECH X ROHITMAN45,No ROHIT SHARMA in IndoPak 11...?? HITMAN definitely deserves to b here!!
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Nikhil Yadav,selecting saeed anwar in place of rohit sharma is just mockery hahaha
oELP_e8Z3Ro,Riaz Kalsekar,"If India Pakistan had remained as one country, UNDIVIDED INDIA, would have ruled the whole world, economically, militarily and diplomatically .<br>The British were wise to forecast the future &amp; know the threat that Europe would lose its importance in the world, with the revival of Powerful India.<br>The Indian Sub Continent is a land of immense talent.."

JgZizKa-5MM,Alexander Bonds,Australia should play like bazzball
JgZizKa-5MM,Kaustav Kashyap,NZ and SA looking quite dangerous too
JgZizKa-5MM,Tips Factory,"What an amazing interview! Wonderful questions, excellent insights by Warney, and great energy between the two. Davey has absolutely zero ego, what a class act, looking forward to more chats like this throughout the world cup @Fox Cricket.<br><br>PS: Also sad that Mark won&#39;t be coming down to India to commentate. One of my favourite commentators of late ❤️"
JgZizKa-5MM,Soumen Chatterjee💛💛,India has beaten Australia only twice since 1996. 2011 and 2019. Otherwise they have the upper hand over India in world cups.
rv2cYvWdjIM,Mahesh,"KL Rahul came out of syllabus 😅, this so remind me of 2011 world cup , I wish I could go back then in time and relive all these years again having my present consciousness"

rv2cYvWdjIM,Rajiv Ranjan,Now everyone knows why Aussie choose jadeja 😅 <br>He took smith like best bowl of the match even after catch drop he took 3 wickets
rv2cYvWdjIM,death track gaming,Jadeja in the squad aged well in ind vs aus
rv2cYvWdjIM,Utkarsh Tripathi,They are just doing &quot;टोटका&quot;
rv2cYvWdjIM,Rafid Nasir,Shakib &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Stokes + Hardik + Jadeja ( Records never lie)
rv2cYvWdjIM,Tushar Sagar,All saying they said to make India overconfident but India did defeat them in first match with hardik and jadega taking most wickets
rv2cYvWdjIM,Palash Roy,where is Shakib?
rv2cYvWdjIM,Aravind Naik,"If this video was shot after their series against SA, they would&#39;ve surely picked up Heinrich Klaasen quoting &quot;Probably best player against the spin currently in the world &amp; his ability to accelerate when needed&quot;. 2023 has been an amazing year for Klaasen so far. That 174(83) was crazy."
rv2cYvWdjIM,CroMs,Stoinis is better than green on Indian pitches.....
rv2cYvWdjIM,Banu sai,"Ok guys accepted Jaddu is not a best all-rounder, <br><br>But best fielder in the world in current history. I think that is Enough.

Pandiya is good all rounder.... But not economical bowler.... Ben Stokes is a best attacking batsman... But not a genuine All rounder....  Jadeja is good all rounder but not ever best Shakib al hasan....  Shakib al hasan is a father of all All rounder....  He is a classy batsman also very economical bowler....

rv2cYvWdjIM,Farukh,Should have been shakib and pandiya. Shakib has a wonderful record you cannot miss him in the middle order.
rv2cYvWdjIM,Major Merc,Well clearly people doesn&#39;t know how fielding can change the game a run out can cost you whole world cup Aussies know this that&#39;s why they went with Jadeja and  Indian conditions gives him added bonus

rv2cYvWdjIM,Dank Rahul,I aggreed... With that team but just want to add moin ali instaed of jadeja because jadeja is not as good as moin in limited overs.... People are saying that shakip is better than jadeja... But i think shakib is a batsman who should play in top 5 ... He is not a finisher... And in this team there is no place in top 5 .... So my vote would go for moin ali
rv2cYvWdjIM,Sports Update,Best World XI should be<br>1)Rohit Sharma <br>2)David Warner<br>3)Virat Kohli<br>4)Kane Williamson<br>5)Jos Butler<br>6)Ben Stokes<br>7)Shakib Al Hasan<br>8) Kuldeep Yadav<br>9) Mitchell Starc<br>10)Jasprit Bumrah<br>11)Trent Bolt
rv2cYvWdjIM,Mahrab Hossain Nobel,Why Jadeja?? Why not Shakib Al Hasan? Would you  please see who is best in this modern cricket?
rv2cYvWdjIM,Abiduzzaman Mazumder Rafin,"Did I just see a World XI without world&#39;s no.1 all-rounder SHAKIB AL HASAN? Do these Australians know when Shakib first went no.1 in the ranking, their darling IPL teammates Jadeja and Pandey were not even professional cricketers? And now almost 15 years later when those 2 are so called best all-rounders in the world, Shakib still holds the no.1 spot? Shakib has 13k+ international runs and 600+ international wickets, couple thousand of those runs and almost hundred of those wickets came in WCs. I feel embarrassed that how much of Indian dick eaters Australians have become."
rv2cYvWdjIM,Sakin Sarwar,Where is Shakib? They say Jadeja is the best all rounder!! Do these aussies even look at the cricketing stats?
rv2cYvWdjIM,Raja Patra,Nice acting..... Hollywood need you guys
rv2cYvWdjIM,Jay Guneswar,They want to do overconfidence  opponent
rv2cYvWdjIM,M. K. Gaming,Aussies being Aussies started those mind games already 😊<br><br>Thanks for 100 likes btw ❤️
rv2cYvWdjIM,Youtube Only,"Is it possible for any cricket video to not dick ride India? Nope, it&#39;s not. I miss the candid days now all the experts, analysts, players, ambassadors just worry about appealing to India&#39;s mass"
rv2cYvWdjIM,Alok Chauhan Vlog's,Jadeja best 👍🏼
rv2cYvWdjIM,Hedwig,Even though I am Indian but Shakib in odi any day better then jadega

rv2cYvWdjIM,RIDWAN AHMED,"Even the fans have better brains them it seems<br><br>Why not Shakib at 4, you get a left arm off spinner , left arm batter and also he fields well, only lefty in middle order<br><br>Why not Rashid at 8? Only leg spinner, also can hold on a side when Hardik charges with bat"
ekwZCwc59WM,Ashutosh Kumar,"Right now ,<br>My current team is<br>Subhman gill<br>David Warner<br>Virat kohli<br>Markaram<br>Ben stokes/shakib al hasan(pitch)<br>Jos buttler<br>Glen maxwell<br>Hardik pandya<br>Kuldeep yadav<br>Trent boult<br>Jasprit bumrah"

ekwZCwc59WM,BALAGOPAL S,"If starc is included, then warner in for de cock, smith in for babar"
ekwZCwc59WM,Ankit Raj,Tbh this team looks unbeatable. But this team against the current Indian team could be epic. Only thing is we need clones
ekwZCwc59WM,MyRandomThoughts,"I though they weren&#39;t picking Ausies, no way Warner is not number 2."
ekwZCwc59WM,gw,david warner <br>rohit sharma <br>kohli <br>smith <br>buttler (wk) (c)<br>ben stokes <br>hardik <br>jadeja /shakib <br>kuldeep <br>starc <br>bumrah (bcz death bowling )
ekwZCwc59WM,Vivek Achar,"Is it from current players who are still playing ? If yes, this list is quite Ok. <br><br>If it is of all time, No. 11 unanimously be Mc Grath"
ekwZCwc59WM,Praditya Kumar Pradhan,Are they  picking world XI by excluding themselves ? or they indirectly saying that only this world XI can beat them in the final 🤔🤔🤔🤔
ekwZCwc59WM,Prakash Singh,5 India players 🙌

ekwZCwc59WM,Fazle Rabby,Aus is not doing great in choosing their own XI....
ekwZCwc59WM,GUGAN MADHAN,Even Australian players picked 5 players from India ❤ and they picked only one player from themselves 😅
ekwZCwc59WM,Bibhuti Bhusan Jagat,"In Australia&#39;s World XI, there are 5 indians :- Rohit, Virat, Hardik, Jadeja, Bumrah. This tells you that INDIA are in pinnacle of international cricket."
ekwZCwc59WM,Aaru,For me best ODI World XI right now...❤ <br>1. David warner <br>2. Rohit sharma <br>3. Virat kohli <br>4. Babar Azam <br>5. Josh butler (wk)<br>6. Ben stokes <br>7. Sakib al hasan <br>8. Rashid Khan <br>9. Kasigo Rabada <br>10. Mitchell Starc <br>11. Jasprit Bumrah <br>Reserved - <br>1. Quinton decock ( wk) <br>2. Kane Williamson ( batsman ) <br>3. Ravindra jadeja ( spin -bowling all-rounder) <br>4. Shaheen shah afridi ( fast bowler) <br> 🤗😍
ekwZCwc59WM,Sam Soh,This XI is basically Aussies kissing India&#39;s ass🙄
ekwZCwc59WM,Harsh Rai,Rashid khan is too overrated in odi.Never had a string of good performances against big teams.Kuldeep yadav is much much better
ekwZCwc59WM,Aryan Verma,This is actual World XI <br>David Warner <br>Rohit Sharma <br>Virat Kohli <br>Baber Azam <br>Ben Stokes <br>Jos Buttler (WK)<br>Glenn Maxwell <br>Mitchell Starc <br>Rashid Khan <br>Jasprit Bumrah <br>Trent Boult
ekwZCwc59WM,Prabal Bhadoria,Ind v NZ final with Ind winning the wc 2023 🎉🎉🎉
ekwZCwc59WM,The Avalanche,Really ?? 5 Indians and just 1 Aussie in the side ?? That is some serious mind game going on...
ekwZCwc59WM,Vibing with Andybot,Just watched this video after India beats Australia 😂
ekwZCwc59WM,Neel Bhave,"I agree with Mitchell Starc, but if you’re the Aussie team, I wouldn’t pick an Aussie. Maybe switch him for Trent Boult"
ekwZCwc59WM,Budensha Liyakath,"Devon conwey<br>Virat kohili<br>Babar Azam<br>Kane Wiillimson<br>Hardik Pandaya<br>Hendrik Klassen <br>Rasheed kahan<br>Kuldeep Yadav<br>Mitchel starck<br>Jasprit Bhoomra<br>Trent Bolt.......<a href=""about:invalid#zCSafez""></a>"
ekwZCwc59WM,MakunaHatata,Mind games by aussies
ekwZCwc59WM,RM GUPTA,best current world XI ...Devon Conway ...shubmann gill.... Joe root...Steve Smith.... virat kohli jos buttler....ravindra jadeja... Shakib ul Hasan...Rashid Khan Josh Hazlewood...bumrah
ekwZCwc59WM,Ritobed Das Goswami,My Current ODI 11 will be - <br>David Warner <br>Rohit Sharma <br>Virat Kohli <br>Babar Azam <br>Ben Stokes <br>Shakib Al Hasan <br>Jos Buttler <br>Rashid Khan <br>Mitchell Starc<br>Trent Boult <br>Jasprit Bumrah<br>12th Man -: Kagiso Rabada
ekwZCwc59WM,Meghan Sharma,"When you&#39;re Australia and you&#39;re picking a World XI and don&#39;t include players like Warner and Smith, it is assumed that you&#39;re picking non-Aussies. But then you include Starc instead of Trent Boult or Shaheen Afridi, you confuse the viewers."
ekwZCwc59WM,twrampage,I think the only reason they included Starc was because it&#39;d stand out if they didn&#39;t. <br><br>A+ on the mind games.
ekwZCwc59WM,Fun Time,Rashid doesn&#39;t fit the ODI guys.. He is a T20 specialist
ekwZCwc59WM,Niraj Kumar,5 indian power of india 😊
ekwZCwc59WM,Niraj Kumar,India je 4 player haha our india is best
ekwZCwc59WM,Shad Khan,Shaheen Afridi 😂😂 kidhar hai Australia ko kya pori duniya ko maloom hai bumrah&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shaheen 😂😂
ekwZCwc59WM,Abhiram,no sledging anymore...<br>just make your opponents overconfident by praising them...<br>great strat aussies...<br>world cup 2023 belongs to INDIA!!
ekwZCwc59WM,Reeju Guha,"Ok now this doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I thought they were picking world xi outside of Australia. But now I realize that they were including Aussies. Then I don&#39;t understand why neither one of Warner, Marsh, Smith, Hazelwood were included. At least Warner was an easy pick."
ekwZCwc59WM,Nandan B K gowda,So australi pic jalf of indian squad then
ekwZCwc59WM,Janak Bamaniya,World class bowling ke bowlers Ka to naam hi nahi ayaa 😅
ekwZCwc59WM,I'm a mystery,Rohit Sharma<br>David Warner <br>Virat Kohli<br>Steve Smith<br>Ben Stokes <br>Jos Butler (wk)<br>Hardik/Curran<br>RavindraJadeja <br>Rashid khan<br>Mitchell Starc<br>Jasprit Bumrah
ekwZCwc59WM,AkhaNDuyitR,Rashid isn&#39;t good choice for ODIs at all
ekwZCwc59WM,Matt Thompson,"You picked the wrong Rashid. Adil, boys,.. Adil."
ekwZCwc59WM,Sume,5 Indians out of 11 🙄 So much buttering... nice tactics..as always. But this time it won&#39;t work. India is playing at home and is balanced.
ekwZCwc59WM,Instant Education,I was waiting to see what Starc will speak about himself😂
ekwZCwc59WM,Jai Bajrangbali,Boom boom bumrah ❤
ekwZCwc59WM,Vishwas Khandelwal,So they were considering Aussies as well and they didn&#39;t pick Warner as Rohit&#39;s partner! SHOCKING<br><br>Butler can keep ! <br>Had to pick Warner ❤😮😮
ekwZCwc59WM,Vëdâñt Mêhtå,kinngg
